"""core/evidence_contract.py — THE FORWARD EVIDENCE CONTRACT (Batch 1, 10-Sep-2026).

Instrumentation ONLY. ⛔ Nothing here may change a single trading decision. The
recorder is an OBSERVER: it is wrapped so it can never raise into the pipeline,
exactly like `signal_processor._sr_observe` and `v3_chain.runner.observe`.

WHY IT EXISTS. Every trading day without it is a day of forward data that cannot
be recovered. `signals.status` keeps a terminal verdict and `screener_results`
keeps the screening detail, but neither preserves the *decision context* at the
moment of the decision — and 68.99 % of the corpus is a screener reject whose
sizing, re-anchoring and provenance are never written down at all.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THREE THINGS THIS MODULE REFUSES TO DO
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. ⛔ NO LOOKAHEAD, NO BACKFILL. A record carries only what was known at the
   capture point. Nothing is reconstructed from a later state, and a gap stays a
   gap: a missing day is a loss, a manufactured day is a corruption.
2. ⛔ NO GIT REF IN THE PROVENANCE. `scripts/forward_shadow_record.py:71-72`
   asks git for HEAD and, because a deployed tree has no `.git`, falls through to
   the BARE repo — stamping `20061b6` onto rows produced by 27 hand-patched
   files. Measured. `code_fingerprint` here hashes the DEPLOYED BYTES instead.
3. ⛔ NO INVENTED IDENTITY. If the arm cannot be resolved, or the fingerprint
   cannot be computed, the record is `FAILED` and says so. It is never quietly
   defaulted and never hidden behind `PARTIAL`.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
record_status — AND WHY PARTIAL IS NARROW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
COMPLETE  every REQUIRED field present, and every OPTIONAL field supplied.
PARTIAL   every REQUIRED field present; some OPTIONAL context absent.
FAILED    a REQUIRED identity/provenance field is missing or unresolvable.

REQUIRED / OPTIONAL / N/A is decided PER CAPTURE POINT (and, at P3, per verdict
shape) by the table after `CONTEXT_FIELDS` -- never by "is this key populated at
all". A P3 verdict has no sl_price because no screening verdict can have one:
that is the correct shape of P3, not a gap, so an absent N/A field leaves the
record COMPLETE. (The first build counted every absent key, so PARTIAL fired on
essentially every record and therefore told nobody anything.)

⚠️ PARTIAL is for missing optional context ONLY. A missing identity or
provenance field is a FAILURE and must be visible. Widening PARTIAL to cover it
would make the corpus look healthier than it is, which is the one thing an
evidence contract must never do.
