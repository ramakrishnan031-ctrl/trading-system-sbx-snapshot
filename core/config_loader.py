"""
core/config_loader.py — Trading System v2

Purpose:
    Single authoritative loader for all non-strategy YAML configuration files.
    Validates every file against a strict Pydantic v2 schema on startup.
    Computes SHA-256 hash of each file for change detection between restarts.

Locked Design Decisions:
    CL1 — load_all(config_dir: Path = Path("config")) → AppConfig.
           Module-level function. No singleton. AppConfig is a Pydantic BaseModel
           holding all 8 sub-configs as typed fields. main.py calls it at Phase 0b,
           holds the result, and passes sub-configs to each subsystem via DI.
    CL2 — Atomic load. All 8 files must parse + validate. Any failure raises
           immediately. No partial AppConfig ever returned.
    CL3 — Strict schemas. Every Pydantic model uses extra="forbid". Unknown
           keys in YAML raise ConfigSchemaError — typos in key names are caught.
    CL4 — SHA-256 hash per file. load_all() stores filename → hex digest in
           AppConfig.file_hashes for Phase 0b config-change detection.
    CL5 — No env-var interpolation, no includes. yaml.safe_load() only.
           Values needing env vars go in .env, read by consumer modules.
    CL6 — All 8 file schemas + AppConfig in one file. Split into
           core/config_schemas/ if file exceeds 600 lines.

Config Files Loaded (strategies/*.yaml NOT handled here — see strategies/loader.py):
    system_config.yaml      → SystemConfig      (P1, P2, P4, P11b, P14, P15, Q1, G4)
    broker_costs.yaml       → BrokerCostsConfig (P12)
    broker_limits.yaml      → BrokerLimitsConfig (G7)
    slippage_model.yaml     → SlippageConfig    (P12)
    scoring_weights.yaml    → ScoringConfig     (P9b)
    scan_webhook_map.yaml   → ScanWebhookMapConfig (P17)
    chartink_scanners.yaml  → ChartinkScannersConfig (P17)
    nse_holidays_2026.yaml  → NseHolidaysConfig

What This Module Does NOT Do:
    - Does not load strategies/*.yaml (handled by strategies/loader.py)
    - Does not read .env files or expand environment variables (CL5)
    - Does not support hot reload — load-once at startup (Phase 0b)
    - Does not fill in defaults for missing keys (CL3: extra="forbid", all required)
    - Does not return a partial config on any error (CL2)

# ── The exclusive upper bound for trading_hours.service_window_end ───────────
# WHY 18:15 AND NOT A ROUND NUMBER: it is the forward-shadow recorder's cron time
# (cron_registry.yaml -> forward_shadow_record, "18:15 Mon-Fri"). That job is the only
# out-of-sample evidence producer in the system and what it writes cannot be
# regenerated. A configured shutdown at/after it would leave the service alive while
# it runs.
#
# This is POSTURE, not a concurrency finding. WAL would in fact tolerate the overlap —
# the 16:05 daily report already reads against the live writer every trading day. The
# rule is that nothing in the evening pipeline should ever have to reason about whether
# a live writer is present. Said plainly on purpose: the weaker "they would contend"
# argument is wrong, and a future reader would be right to relax a bound resting on it.
#
# DRIFT-GUARDED, not merely commented — tests/unit/test_service_window_config.py::
# test_max_is_before_the_forward_shadow_job reads the schedule from the registry and
# fails if this bound ever reaches it. Move that cron and the bound must move with it.
#
# SECOND ROLE: main.SERVICE_START_CUTOFF binds to this value, so the LATEST the service
# may START is >= every legal stop time. That makes the crash-restart trap
# unrepresentable rather than untested.

def load_all(config_dir: Path = Path("config")) -> AppConfig:
    """
    Load and validate all 8 config files from config_dir (CL1, CL2).

    Reads each file, hashes raw bytes (CL4), parses YAML with safe_load (CL5),
    and validates against the corresponding Pydantic schema (CL3). All 8 files
    must succeed — any failure raises immediately; no partial AppConfig returned.

    Args:
        config_dir: directory containing the YAML files.
                    Default is Path("config") relative to the process cwd.
                    Override in tests by passing a tmp directory.

    Returns:
        AppConfig with all validated sub-configs and file_hashes populated.

    Raises:
        ConfigMissingError: a required file does not exist.
        ConfigSchemaError:  a file exists but YAML parse or schema validation fails.
