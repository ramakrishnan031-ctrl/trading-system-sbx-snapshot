capital/risk_engine.py -- Trading System v2

Purpose:
    Portfolio-level pre-trade approval gate. Validates a proposed trade
    against ALL portfolio limits in one atomic check. Returns approve/reject
    with reason. No state mutation. No side effects. Pure decision function.

Locked Design Decisions:
    RE1  -- Single pre-trade approval gate. Returns ApprovalResult.
            No state mutation. No side effects. Pure decision function.
    RE2  -- No hardcoded 1% estimate. Uses SizingResult.margin_required
            and SizingResult.risk_amount directly (schism eliminated).
    RE3  -- Constructor: RiskEngine(fund_manager, state_store,
            max_open_positions, max_daily_trades, max_sector_exposure_pct,
            max_consecutive_losses, daily_loss_limit_pct, sector_lookup_fn,
            logger, kill_switch=None).
    RE4  -- API: approve(symbol, side, intent, sizing_result, signal_id)
            -> ApprovalResult (frozen dataclass).
    RE5  -- Check sequence (10 checks, short-circuit on first fail):
            KILL_SWITCH, SIZING_VALID, CAPITAL, OPEN_POSITIONS,
            DAILY_TRADES, CONSECUTIVE_LOSSES, DAILY_LOSS,
            SECTOR_EXPOSURE, CONTRARY_POSITION, DUPLICATE_SYMBOL.
    RE6  -- SECTOR_EXPOSURE counts BOTH open and in-flight (RE6 audit fix).
    RE7  -- DAILY_LOSS uses fund_manager.get_snapshot().daily_realized_pnl.
            risk_engine is a gate, not a monitor.
    RE8  -- kill_switch=None: KILL_SWITCH check skipped, WARNING logged once
            at construction. Last-mile check; order_placer re-checks too.
    RE9  -- sector_lookup_fn exception: treat as "UNKNOWN", log WARNING.
    RE10 -- Consecutive losses: net_pnl < -1e-6 (audit fix: breakeven != loss).
    RE11 -- Snapshot consistency: all reads happen in approve() body.
            ApprovalResult.snapshot has all 9 fields for every call.
    RE12 -- Approval logged INFO. No state_store writes. Pure read + decide.
    RE14 -- Layer 4 (capital/). Imports: stdlib, core.logger, core.exceptions,
            capital.fund_manager (type), capital.position_sizer (type),
            core.state_store (for queries). No kill_switch import (injected).
    RE16 -- Deterministic. Date read once per approve() call. Same inputs
            + same state -> same ApprovalResult.
    RE17 -- NOT in scope: capital reservation, order placement, position
            monitoring, unrealized P&L tracking.
    RE18 -- (22-Aug-2026, fix item 1) DAILY_LOSS and SECTOR_EXPOSURE are PER BOOK.
            A delivery (CNC) entry is gated on delivery_daily_loss_limit_pct /
            delivery_max_sector_exposure_pct; an intraday entry on the global pair.
            An unset delivery limit RAISES; it is never replaced by the global one.
            Scope note: the delivery daily-loss limit governs this PRE-TRADE gate
            only — fund_manager's post-close portfolio circuit breaker stays global,
            because one account-wide realized P&L exists and there is no per-book
            attribution to split it with. CONSECUTIVE_LOSSES stays shared by design.

What This Module Does NOT Do:
    - Does not reserve or release capital (fund_manager does that)
    - Does not place orders (order_manager does that)
    - Does not monitor open positions (order_monitor does that)
    - Does not track unrealized P&L
    - Does not write to state_store or emit events

        FIX-185-class TOCTOU close for the SECTOR_EXPOSURE gate.

        `existing_sector_margin` (StateStore.sector_exposure) sums TRADE ROWS only, so a
        RESERVED-NOT-PLACED reservation — fund_manager.reserve() succeeded but its PENDING_FILL
        trade row is written later, OUTSIDE portfolio_lock — is invisible here, and two concurrent
        same-sector signals can each read stale exposure and together breach _max_sector_pct.
        approve() runs inside portfolio_lock (same seam the FIX-185 count gate already reads
        reservations from), so the live reservation set is a consistent read.

        Partition so every unit is counted EXACTLY ONCE (mirrors the FIX-185 count partition):
          • open_partial = sector_exposure(sector, statuses=("OPEN","PARTIAL")) — trade rows whose
            reservation was already popped at fill, hence NOT in get_live_reservations().
          • reserved     = Σ margin of live reservations in this sector = reserved-not-placed
            PLUS any PENDING_FILL still holding its reservation.
        open_partial + reserved therefore never double-counts a PENDING_FILL.

        Returns max(existing, open_partial + reserved): floored by DB truth (covers a restart that
        lost in-memory reservations but kept PENDING_FILL rows) and can ONLY harden, never loosen.
        Degrades to DB truth — but LOUDLY (never silently) — if the fund_manager predates
        get_live_reservations() or the read raises.
