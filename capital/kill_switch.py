capital/kill_switch.py -- Trading System v2

Purpose:
    System-wide trading halt mechanism. Three modes: INACTIVE (normal),
    SOFT_KILL (block new entries, allow exits), HARD_KILL (block ALL orders,
    attempt broker cancellation). Last-mile gate per Project Rule 13.

Locked Design Decisions:
    KS1  -- Three modes: INACTIVE / SOFT_KILL / HARD_KILL.
            is_active(intent) tests by intent type.
    KS2  -- Single state: KillState enum. Persisted to kill_switch_state
            table for restart recovery.
    KS3  -- Startup recovery: constructor reads persisted state. If state
            != INACTIVE, log CRITICAL and remain halted. Operator must
            call resume() to clear. Audit Issue #18 fix.
    KS4  -- Deadlock prevention: RLock not Lock. soft_kill() / hard_kill()
            may call internal methods that re-acquire the lock. RLock
            allows reentrant acquisition by the same thread.
            Audit Issue #4 fix.
    KS5  -- Constructor: KillSwitch(state_store, bus, logger,
            on_hard_kill_cancel_fn=None, api_failure_threshold=3,
            enable_auto_trip=True).
    KS6  -- Public API: is_active(intent), current_state(), status(),
            soft_kill(), hard_kill(), resume(), record_api_failure(),
            record_success().
    KS7  -- Auto-trip: api_failure_threshold consecutive failures trigger
            soft_kill(). Disabled when enable_auto_trip=False.
    KS8  -- KillSwitchActivated event on every state change including
            resume(). Payload includes previous_state, new_state,
            triggered_by (per KS8 extension).
    KS9  -- State persisted in kill_switch_state table (single row,
            id=1). Persist BEFORE in-memory update. If persist fails,
            abort: no state change, no event.
    KS10 -- get_kill_info() convenience method for startup_checks /
            --status flag. Audit Issue: was missing.
    KS11 -- Layer 4 (capital/). Imports: stdlib, core.exceptions,
            core.events, core.logger, core.time_authority, core.state_store.
            NO cancel logic inside (injected callback).
    KS12 -- Deterministic: is_active() depends ONLY on current state.
    KS13 -- NOT in scope: deciding when to auto-trip, performing broker
            cancellations, restart after halt.

    [SUPERSEDED 2026-07-22, doc-only — KS5/KS11/KS13 originals above left
    legible.] These predate the adapter-driven HARD_KILL flatten. The
    constructor now ALSO takes adapter (FIX-087), notifier, mode and
    emergency_exit_buffer_pct (see __init__), and the kill_switch PERFORMS the
    flatten + broker cancellations DIRECTLY via that injected adapter — the
    M-C8 async flatten worker + FIX-181 marketable-LIMIT exits/orphan sweep +
    FIX-190 Bug A/E reverse-aware cancel-then-flatten. The on_hard_kill_cancel_fn
    callback is retained only as a LEGACY FALLBACK when no adapter is injected
    (_run_cancel_fn, ~:904/939). So "no cancel logic inside / does not perform
    broker cancellations (injected callback)" describes the pre-adapter design,
    not the current one.

What This Module Does NOT Do:
    - Does not decide WHEN to call record_api_failure (callers decide)
    - Does not perform broker order cancellations (injected callback)
      [SUPERSEDED 2026-07-22: NOW performs them DIRECTLY via the injected adapter;
      the callback is a legacy fallback — see the KS5/KS11/KS13 note above]
    - Does not restart trading after halt (manual resume() only)
    - Does not send Telegram alerts (logger CRITICAL is the signal)
    - Does not import from any layer above capital/

        and RETURNS IMMEDIATELY; the returned report carries dispatched=True and is
        NOT a result. Previously the caller's thread ran the whole retry loop, up to
        _HARD_KILL_MAX_RETRY_HOURS — and the callers are on the fill/commit path,

        FIX-087: Indestructible per-trade exit loop.

        If adapter is set, fetch all open trades and exit each with MARKET orders.
        Each trade is wrapped in try/except; failed trades are retried infinitely
        with exponential backoff (5s, 15s, 45s, then capped at 45s). This is
        intentional - during HARD_KILL the system MUST NOT give up on flattening.

        If adapter is not set, falls back to legacy callback (on_hard_kill_cancel_fn).

        M-C8 (16-Jul-2026): the ADAPTER path now DISPATCHES the exit loop to a
        worker thread and returns immediately (fire-and-return). It used to run on
        the caller's thread, and several callers are on the fill/commit path
        (order_placer:1499/:3750, fund_manager:974/:2259, drift_handler:231,
        main:647) — so a HARD_KILL could starve the fill/event pipeline for up to
        _HARD_KILL_MAX_RETRY_HOURS while the flatten retried. The flatten itself
        was never the problem; blocking the caller was.

        The LEGACY cancel_fn path below stays SYNCHRONOUS, and
        _exit_all_trades_indestructible stays a synchronous internal method. That
        split is load-bearing, not incidental: production always calls set_adapter
        (main.py:1983) so production always takes the adapter path, while the tests
        that assert on a real CancellationReport reach the loop through the legacy
        cancel_fn or by calling the internal method directly. Keeping both sync is
        what lets the async change land without disturbing them. Do not "tidy" the
        two paths into one.

        Caveat, learned the hard way (M-C8): the claim "no existing test calls
        hard_kill() with an adapter set" was WRONG when this was written —
        test_p0_live_day1_fixes.py::TestBugC_KillSwitchExit did exactly that and
        broke. Those tests now call the internal method directly like their
        siblings. If you add a test that drives hard_kill() with an adapter, it
        gets a DISPATCH, not a result: drain_flatten() first, then assert.
