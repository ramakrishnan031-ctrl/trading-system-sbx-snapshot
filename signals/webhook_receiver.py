"""
signals/webhook_receiver.py -- Trading System v2

Purpose:
    Flask-based HTTP entry point for Chartink scanner webhooks.
    Validates payload, deduplicates, enforces backpressure/expiry,
    and enqueues (signal_id, scanner_name, symbol, price, triggered_at)
    tuples for downstream signal_processor. Never blocks on heavy work.

Locked Design Decisions:
    WR1  -- HTTP-facing gateway; no heavy work in request thread
    WR2  -- Flask, single file; POST /webhook/<scanner_name> + GET /health
    WR3  -- Constructor: signal_queue, state_store, config, market_windows,
             kill_switch, logger, secret_token=None
    WR4  -- Payload: stocks, trigger_prices, triggered_at, scan_name
    WR5  -- Response codes: 200/400/401/403/404/503/500
    WR6  -- Backpressure (503) + per-signal expiry check
    WR7  -- SHA-256 fingerprint dedup at minute precision
    WR8  -- Optional HMAC validation via X-Webhook-Signature header
    WR9  -- Insert into signals table then push to queue
    WR10 -- Per-signal status: ACCEPTED/DUPLICATE/EXPIRED/INVALID_SYMBOL/
             INVALID_PRICE/QUEUE_FULL/STORE_ERROR/OUTSIDE_HOURS/IN_PROCESS
    WR11 -- Thread-safe; each Flask request in its own thread
    WR12 -- stop() for graceful shutdown
    WR13 -- webhook_audit row per POST regardless of outcome
    WR14 -- signal_queue.expiry_sec + webhook config section
    WR15 -- Layer 5 (signals/)
    WR16 -- NOT in scope: screening, strategy lookup, order placement
    WR17 -- In-flight symbol tracking to prevent concurrent processing

What This Module Does NOT Do:
    - Does not screen or score signals (signals/signal_processor)
    - Does not look up strategies or map scanner to order parameters
    - Does not place orders
    - Does not send Telegram alerts on rejection

        * `hmac_payload` -- what the signature is computed over. The raw body on
          POST /webhook; b"" on GET /health, because a GET carries no body. A

          indefinitely replayable; /webhook's is body-bound and is not.
        * `reason` -- /webhook's granular message. /health DISCARDS it and

          anonymous caller whether require_hmac is on. See both callers.
