"""
alerts/cron_alerts.py -- Trading System v2  (TASK #3 / Cron Officer)

Per-job cron alert POLICY. Maps a job's heartbeat outcome to a TelegramNotifier
severity and sends it; the existing tiered delivery then does the rest:

    CRITICAL -> writes a sentinel FIRST (alert_watcher emails it) + Telegram +
                direct SMTP fallback (FIX-132). This IS the Telegram->Email fallback.
    ERROR    -> Telegram; failed_alerts.log on Telegram failure.
    INFO     -> Telegram only.

Policy (Cron Officer Layer 3B):
    FAILED  + critical job -> CRITICAL   (escalates to email)
    FAILED  + non-critical -> ERROR
    SUCCESS + critical job -> INFO       (confirmation)
    SUCCESS + non-critical -> silent     (noise reduction)
    SKIPPED / PARTIAL      -> silent

Honors the telegram.enabled master switch: TelegramNotifier.from_env() returns a
notifier whose send() is a silent no-op when the switch is OFF — so OFF means
fully silent (no Telegram, no sentinel, no email), by design (TASK-10).

    Returns True/False when the registry answers, and **None when it cannot** —
    unreadable YAML, missing file, unknown job. The distinction matters: this used to
    swallow every error and return False, i.e. "not critical". A registry problem
    therefore DOWNGRADED a critical job's FAILED alert from CRITICAL to ERROR, and only
    CRITICAL carries the email fallback — so the one alert that most needed to escalate
    lost its escalation, silently, precisely when the config was broken. "I don't know"
    is not "no"; see alert_job_result for how the unknown is resolved per status.
