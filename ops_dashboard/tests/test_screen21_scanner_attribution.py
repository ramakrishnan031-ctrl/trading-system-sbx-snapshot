"""SCREEN 21 — SCANNER ATTRIBUTION.

The approved design (`gui/21. Scanner_Attribution.png` + `.txt`) is binding for
STRUCTURE; the DATA is this system's.

⭐ THE CENTRAL PROPERTY OF THIS SCREEN: the main table shows **Strategy** and
⛔ NOT a separate **Scanner** column, because the two are 1:1 in this system.
That is MEASURED here against the real `scan_webhook_map.yaml`, ⛔ not asserted:
if a future map ever made one strategy serve two scanners, the measurement test
goes red and the removal has to be re-argued rather than silently inherited.

⭐ THE SECOND PROPERTY: Signals, Accepted and Rejected all share the STORED-
SIGNAL base, and the rejection donut splits exactly the Rejected set — so its
four buckets sum to the Rejected column and to 100%. That is the discipline
Screen 20's donut was corrected to on 16-Aug after it read 36% + 68% = 104%.

⚠️ The shared fixture rejects signals under TWO different structured statuses
(REJECTED_DAILY_LOSS ×3 → Risk Limit, REJECTED_CAPITAL ×2 → Capital Limit) and
ALSO stores an expired and ten duplicate signals, so the bucket assertions have
failing inputs available in both directions: a classifier that swept everything
into one bucket, and one that counted expired/duplicate as rejections, both go
red.
