"""Screen 10 — Slippage Analytics.

Covers the three rulings the screen had to apply to the reference design
(Scanner removed · "Signal Score" not resurrected · Screen-08/09 alignment by
column role) and the data-integrity rules it must not break: one filtered
population behind every panel, a status partition that always adds up, an
UNMEASURED row that can never pass as a clean fill, the per-trade tolerance the
order path actually applied, five price buckets that always render, and an
export that cannot disagree with the table.

⭐ Assertions are anchored to the fixture's KNOWN values or to a PROPERTY that
must hold. ⛔ No assertion is written by reading back what the code happened to
produce.

FIXTURE ARITHMETIC (conftest), so every number below is traceable:
  TODAY   trd_c1  AAA @1000  slip 3.00  dist 10  frac 0.15 (symbol:AAA)
                  ⇒ allowed min(10×0.15, 5) = 1.50 ⇒ 200%  → EXCEEDED
  TODAY   trd_c4  AAA @1000  slip 0.50  dist 10  frac —    (config-global 0.22)
                  ⇒ allowed min(10×0.22, 5) = 2.20 ⇒  23%  → WITHIN_LIMIT
  YDAY    trd_w1  BBB @  85  slip 0.30  dist  5              ⇒  27%  → WITHIN_LIMIT
