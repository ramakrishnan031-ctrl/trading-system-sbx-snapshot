opened READ-ONLY (``file:<abs>?mode=ro``, uri=True) with a 30s busy_timeout and
the analytics DB ATTACHed the same read-only way (ATTACH order replicated from

    day `closed_trades_range` keys on. The two screens therefore answer slightly
    different questions on a trade that spans midnight, which is correct: Screen

    `slippage_rows_range`: a silent truncation would let the KPI deck, the timing
    table, the rankings and the distribution describe DIFFERENT populations with
    nothing on screen saying so.

    ⚠️⚠️ WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT MEASURE — read before adding a column.
    The reference design asks for EIGHT lifecycle instants (signal · validation ·
    risk · capital · order-create · order-submit · exchange-accept · fill). This
    system records FOUR, and the gap is a REAL INSTRUMENTATION GAP, ⛔ not an
    oversight in this reader:

      ✅ signal        `signals.received_at`      (and `triggered_at` upstream)
      ✅ screening     `screener_results.ts` + its per-step `latencies` JSON
      ✅ order submit  `orders.placed_at`   (ENTRY leg)
      ✅ fill          `orders.filled_at`   (ENTRY leg)

      ⛔ risk evaluation      — NO timestamp exists anywhere in the codebase
      ⛔ capital evaluation   — NO timestamp exists anywhere in the codebase
      ⛔ order CREATE         — `orders` has ONE instant (`placed_at`); there is
                                no create/submit pair to subtract
      ⛔ exchange accept      — `order_execution_log.exchange_timestamp` EXISTS
                                as a column but is NEVER WRITTEN: the only caller
                                of `insert_order_execution_log`
                                (orders/slippage_recorder.py:149) does not set
                                the key, so it is structurally always NULL

    ⇒ the three persisted delays below are the ONLY ones derivable, and
    `signal_to_order_ms` is a COMPOSITE that CONTAINS validation, risk, capital,
    order-create and submit. ⛔ It must never be relabelled as any one of them.

    LATENCY PROVENANCE (orders/order_manager.py:454-456), quoted so the screen
    cannot drift from the writer:
      signal_to_order_ms = signals.received_at → ENTRY orders.placed_at
      order_to_fill_ms   = ENTRY orders.placed_at → filled_at
      total_latency_ms   = signals.received_at → filled_at

    ⚠️ `total_latency_ms` is computed INDEPENDENTLY from the same two endpoints,
    ⛔ not as the sum of the other two, and each is separately clamped to ≥ 0 for
    NTP skew. So `total == part1 + part2` is a PROPERTY TO CHECK, ⛔ not an
    identity to assume — the service reports any row where it fails.

    ⚠️ All three are written ONLY by `_compute_and_store_latency`, which runs ONLY
    on fill. A PENDING or REJECTED trade therefore carries NULL, and that is
    CORRECT: it has no fill time. ⛔ Never impute one.

    `product` and the ENTRY order's own `status`/`rejection_reason` come from the
    ENTRY row via CORRELATED SUBQUERIES — ⛔ never a LEFT JOIN, which would FAN
    OUT on a trade with more than one ENTRY row.

    CANONICAL NAMING — Rama, 13-Aug-2026, and it is SYSTEM-WIDE, not a
    Screen-07 preference:
      * system_score    = `screener_results.score`         — the ACHIEVED score.
      * score_threshold = `screener_results.eligible_score` — the minimum the
        signal had to reach (v14: per-strategy min_score threshold).

    ⛔ "Signal Score" is RETIRED as a label and as a key. ⛔ A threshold is never
    presented as a score under any name — if a threshold is shown it is called
    "Score Threshold". His words: *"Do not fabricate or relabel a threshold as a
    score."*

    ⚠️ THIS REVERSES THE MAPPING THIS FUNCTION SHIPPED UNTIL 13-Aug. It used to
    return `system_score = eligible_score` (the THRESHOLD) and
    `signal_score = score`. That was the 11-Aug Screen-04 supersession of L8;
    tonight's ruling RESTORES L8 (`docs/G5_REDESIGN_PHASE_B.md:11`) and makes it
    apply everywhere. ⭐ It also removes a real split-brain: `screener_scores()`
    below has always returned the ACHIEVED score under the name "System Score"
    for analytics/operations/trade_explorer/trade_logs, so the codebase carried
    BOTH meanings of the same label at once.

    `eligible_score` is a v14 column: on an older DB (and in the test fixture)
    it does not exist, so the SELECT is retried without it and score_threshold
    comes back None — the caller then falls back to the configured
    `min_pass_score`. Nothing here is ever fabricated.

#   ROI          net_pnl / margin_reserved            — realised return on the
#                capital actually COMMITTED. ⛔ NOT on the leveraged notional
#                (qty x price), which would flatter every intraday row by the
#                leverage factor. margin_reserved is populated and > 0 on all
#                603 trades (measured 13-Aug), so the denominator is real.
#   R-multiple   net_pnl / risk_amount                — the realised outcome in
#                units of the risk taken. ⛔ A DIFFERENT QUANTITY FROM R:R and
#                never a substitute for it: R:R is what was PLANNED, R-multiple
#                is what was ACHIEVED. Both are shown, side by side.
#   SL/TGT       Filled = the price at which that leg ACTUALLY EXECUTED, and it
#                exists here only because a CLOSED trade records it.
#
# ⛔⛔ THE FILLED COLUMNS ARE NOT FABRICATED, AND THE RULE IS NARROW:
#    orders.avg_fill_price is STILL NULL on all 977 orders ever placed
#    (re-measured 13-Aug: ENTRY 469 / SL 247 / TGT 235 / EOD 26, zero populated
#    in every leg) — Screen-06's finding reproduces on a larger corpus. The
#    executed price lives on trades.exit_price, and trades.exit_reason NAMES the
#    leg that fired. So, and ONLY so:
#        exit_reason = SL_HIT   ⇒ SL (Filled)  = exit_price
#        exit_reason = TGT_HIT  ⇒ TGT (Filled) = exit_price
#    Every other reason leaves BOTH empty. ⚠️ GTT_EXIT is a MECHANISM, not a
#    leg — it does not say whether the stop or the target went, so it fills
#    NEITHER column (the same treatment _position_status_of gives it).
#    (P) 114/114 SL_HIT and 76/76 TGT_HIT rows carry an exit_price.

# Each reader therefore admits a row when ANY of its own event-bearing stamps

# event's OWN timestamp. ⇒ every event lands in exactly one window, so the
# population can neither double-count nor lose a row.

# ADDITIVE: `config_snapshot_history` above is byte-unchanged and keeps its
# callers (M20 drift banner / last-change date). It selects date+ts+hash ONLY,
# which is all the drift banner needs; the approved CONFIGURATION COMPARISON and
# CONFIGURATION HISTORY panels need the SNAPSHOT BODY as well, because a real
# "Parameter / Old Value / New Value" row can only come from diffing two
# config_json trees. ⛔ Nothing here is derived from a hash — a hash says THAT
# something changed, never WHAT.
