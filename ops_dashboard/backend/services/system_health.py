SCREEN 12 — SYSTEM HEALTH.  Read-only over the existing host/db/metrics readers;
NO schema, NO new probe, NO write path.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT IS REAL, AND WHAT IS NOT INSTRUMENTED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The reference design (`gui/12. System_Health.txt` + PNG) lists metrics this
system does not all collect. Following the Screen-11 precedent, every unmeasured
metric is emitted with `measured: false` and a reason and rendered as an
explicit gap — ⛔ never as 0, and ⛔ never as green.

  MEASURED
  ✅ systemd unit state / started-at / uptime / restarts  `systemctl show`
  ✅ trading-engine liveness + per-component checks       :8080/health
  ✅ trading-engine uptime                                health.uptime_seconds
  ✅ health-endpoint response time                        measured round trip
  ✅ database reachable / size / query latency / schema   file + timed query
  ✅ last successful order                                orders.filled_at
  ✅ last DB backup                                       data_store/backups/
  ✅ disk %                                               shutil (all platforms)
  ✅ RAM available + system load                          /proc + getloadavg (LINUX ONLY)
  ✅ readiness = LIVE required-service state × preflight   services × preflight_runs
  ✅ preflight per-group checks (HISTORICAL)              preflight_runs / _check_results
  ✅ disk % THROUGH DAY                                   analytics.system_metrics
  ✅ auto-recovery lifecycle                              preflight_autofix_log
  ✅ service events                                       system_events
  ✅ alerts                                               telegram_alerts · control_tower · sentinels

  ⛔ NOT INSTRUMENTED — no value is shown
  ⛔ CPU %          `system_metrics.cpu_pct` is a -1.0 SENTINEL. Source states it
                    outright: scripts/capture_metrics_baseline.py:121-126 —
                    "psutil is absent from the VM venv … [cpu/memory] still need
                    psutil and stay -1.0 — separate ticket".
  ⛔ RAM % history  same sentinel (`memory_mb`). The LIVE figure exists on Linux
                    as MemAvailable KB, but /proc/meminfo's MemTotal is not read,
                    so a PERCENTAGE cannot be formed without inventing a
                    denominator.
  ⛔ Network        no bandwidth/throughput metric exists anywhere in the repo.
  ⛔ Response-time history  only the CURRENT round trip is measured; nothing
                    persists it, so "Response Time Through Day" has no series.
  ⛔ DB connection count    SQLite is embedded — there is no server and no pool.

⛔⛔ THE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: a health screen that shows green for
something it did not measure is worse than no health screen. `UNKNOWN` is a
first-class state here and is coloured GREY, ⛔ never green.

    ⚠️⚠️ THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES (Rama, 15-Aug, blocking): the first build made
    preflight's MORNING verdict the headline answer and merely printed a warning
    underneath when live state contradicted it. The screen therefore rendered
    **"Trading Readiness: READY" beside "Trading Engine: FAILED"** — it answered
    its own headline question, *"is trading safe right now?"*, with a stale yes.
    His ruling, quoted: *"Make the live readiness verdict authoritative … A stale
    preflight READY result must never remain the main current READY state after a
    required live service has failed."*

    ⭐ I had argued the GUI should not overrule preflight. That was wrong in the

    ⛔ no new table, and ⛔ nothing derived from a capped row list, which would
    make a busy hour look calm on exactly the day that mattered.

    ⚠️ THE THIRD SERIES IS `trades.entry_time`, ⛔ NOT an order status. A trade
    row exists once its ENTRY actually filled, so it is the honest count of
    fills; reading `orders.status` instead would count a broker acknowledgement

    no bars — which is why `instrumented` is True and the screen says NO

    own orders, and ⭐ that claim would be false.
