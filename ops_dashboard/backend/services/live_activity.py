"""SCREEN 18 — LIVE ACTIVITY.  The Mission Control Wall.

`gui/18. Live_Activity.png` + `.txt` are BINDING for structure.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⭐ WHAT THIS SCREEN CAN AND CANNOT KNOW — measured before a line was written

REAL, from this system's own stores:
  · the FEED — signals · ENTRY orders · positions opened · trades closed ·
    risk rejections + the kill switch · fm_ledger · system_events +
    cron_heartbeat · telegram_alerts. Eight sources, one per approved CATEGORY.
  · the PIPELINE — six stages counted off ONE base (today's stored signals).
  · STRATEGY ACTIVITY, RECENT WINNERS/LOSERS, ACTIVE POSITIONS (system side),
    CAPITAL UTILIZATION, MARKET PULSE — all from stored rows and stamps.

⛔ CURRENT MTM IS NOT INSTRUMENTED, AND IT IS THE HEADLINE GAP OF THIS SCREEN.
   It needs a live price. `ops_dashboard` has ZERO live-price call sites — the
   finding Screen 06 measured across the whole backend and `/api/positions`
   already declares ltp/mtm/unrealized/current_rr UNAVAILABLE, "Pending Broker
   Source (G4)". The KPI card and the ACTIVE POSITIONS columns LTP / MTM (₹) /
   MTM (%) therefore render the established NOT INSTRUMENTED state. ⭐ Today's
   REALIZED P&L is real and is a DIFFERENT quantity; the two are never
   substituted for each other.

⛔ THE OPEN-POSITIONS DELTA IS NOT INSTRUMENTED EITHER. "Open Positions" is a
   LIVE `trades.status` read; nothing stores what that set held at any past
   instant, and reconstructing one from entry/exit stamps would answer a
   different question from the card above it. Signals and Orders DO have a real
   yesterday — they are dated rows — so those two deltas are measured.

⛔ NO "ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL" CLAIM IS PRINTED AS A MEASUREMENT. Nothing here
   measures the health of all services, and Screen 12 already ruled that the
   reference's Signal/Risk/Capital/Order "engines" are THREADS inside one
   systemd service, so a per-engine verdict cannot be claimed. TRADING STATUS
   shows the state that IS measured — the kill switch and the market phase —
   and prints that basis underneath.

⛔ TWO OF THE FOUR APPROVED SYSTEM-EVENT EXAMPLES HAVE NO SOURCE. `system_events`
   records STARTUP / SHUTDOWN / CRASH_DETECTED / CONFIG_DIFF / RECOVERY /
   KILL_AUTO_CLEARED / EOD_SKIPPED_LATE — so Service Restarted and Recovery
   Triggered are evidenced, while Broker Reconnected and Database Warning are
   not written by anything. They are declared uninstrumented, ⛔ never shown as 0
   and ⛔ never synthesised from a log line's severity.

⛔ LIVE MODE AND THE FEED PAUSE ARE DISPLAY CONTROLS. They start and stop THIS
   PAGE's polling. There is no write path anywhere in this dashboard (L4) and
   neither control touches the trading system.

# ⛔ It does NOT build the wall (KPI strip / pipeline / capital / positions):
# `/api/dashboard` is polled every 5 s in market hours and the dashboard panel
# needs the feed alone.
#
# ⛔ WHY NOT `system_events` — the source this panel used until 18-Aug. MEASURED
# ON PRODUCTION (18-Aug-2026 12:09 IST, read-only): `system_events` holds ONLY
# STARTUP (74) · SHUTDOWN (72) · KILL_AUTO_CLEARED (40) · CONFIG_DIFF (28) —
# ⛔ ZERO trading events, all time. The approved artwork's rows are all TRADING
# events, so that source could never have shown what the panel promises. Its
# newest ten rows also spanned 13-Aug → 18-Aug with only TWO from today, while
# the template printed HH:MM:SS only — six days of boot noise read as today.
DASH_FEED_LIMIT = 10

#: The longest note this feed will emit. ⭐ THE BOUND IS THE FIX, and it is
#: enforced HERE rather than in CSS: the panel sits in a `46fr 29fr 25fr` grid
#: whose track width is set by its widest unbreakable content, so an unbounded
#: payload does not merely look wrong — it WIDENS THE WHOLE PAGE. The old feed

#: derived this by substring-matching the event TEXT (`evCat()`), and against
#: production's four `system_events` types every row fell through to one bucket
#: — four of its five branches were unreachable.
#: ⭐ The artwork draws SIGNAL / ORDER / RISK / EXIT; the remaining four
#: categories carry their own badge rather than being folded into a near-enough
#: one. `Trade` → EXIT because the artwork badges SL Hit / TGT Hit / Trade
#: Closed — all of them exits — with EXIT.
