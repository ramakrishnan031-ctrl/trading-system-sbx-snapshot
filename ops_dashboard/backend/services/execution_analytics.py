SCREEN 11 — EXECUTION ANALYTICS.  Pure aggregation over the read-only
`db_reader.execution_rows_range` spine; NO schema, NO mode branch (paper/live
aggregate identically), NO write path anywhere.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE INSTRUMENTATION GAP — READ THIS BEFORE ADDING ANY DELAY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The reference design (`gui/11. Execution_Analytics.txt` + PNG) asks for EIGHT
lifecycle instants and SEVEN delays. This system records FOUR instants and
THREE delays. That is a REAL GAP in the trading system's instrumentation, ⛔ not
a shortfall of this screen, and the screen REPORTS it rather than hiding it:

  MEASURED                          SOURCE
  ✅ Signal Time                    `signals.received_at`
  ✅ Screening time (per step)      `screener_results.latencies` (10 steps)
  ✅ Order Submit Time              ENTRY `orders.placed_at`
  ✅ Fill Time                      ENTRY `orders.filled_at`
  ✅ Signal→Order Delay             `trades.signal_to_order_ms`
  ✅ Fill Delay                     `trades.order_to_fill_ms`
  ✅ Total Delay                    `trades.total_latency_ms`

  NOT INSTRUMENTED — ⛔ no timestamp exists, so NO value is shown
  ⛔ Risk Delay              no risk-evaluation timestamp anywhere in the repo
  ⛔ Capital Delay           no capital-evaluation timestamp anywhere
  ⛔ Order Create Time       `orders` has ONE instant; no create/submit pair
  ⛔ Exchange Accept / Delay `order_execution_log.exchange_timestamp` is a real
                             column that is NEVER WRITTEN — the sole caller of
                             `insert_order_execution_log`
                             (orders/slippage_recorder.py:149) omits the key
  ⛔ Broker Delay            no broker-side instant is recorded at all

⛔⛔ THE ONE THING THIS MODULE MUST NEVER DO is present a missing stage as a
number. A `0.00 sec` risk delay would read as "measured, and it was instant" —
the precise opposite of the truth, on a screen whose entire job is to say WHERE
the time goes. Every unmeasured stage is emitted with `measured: false` and a
`reason`, and the UI renders it as an explicit gap.

⚠️ `signal_to_order_ms` is a COMPOSITE: it spans validation, risk, capital,
order-create AND submit. It is labelled "Signal → Order" for that reason and
⛔ must never be relabelled as any single one of those stages.

DOCUMENTED FORMULAS — every one carries its BASE:
  delay_sec        = ms / 1000, from the persisted column ⛔ never re-derived
  total identity   total_latency_ms ?= signal_to_order_ms + order_to_fill_ms
                   — a PROPERTY CHECKED per row, ⛔ not assumed (each is clamped
                   to ≥0 independently for NTP skew, so they can disagree)
  status           BASE = TOTAL delay seconds, the approved bands:
                     FAST 0–2s · MODERATE 2–5s · SLOW >5s
                     ⛔ a row with no total is UNMEASURED, never FAST
  bucket           BASE = TOTAL delay seconds: 0-1 · 1-2 · 2-5 · 5-10 · 10+
  throughput       counts PER MINUTE from three independent clocks:
                     signals   `signals.received_at`
                     created   ENTRY `orders.placed_at`
                     filled    ENTRY `orders.filled_at`
                   ⛔ never one series divided into three.

    ⚠️⚠️ REBUILT after the first version drew a misleading chart, and the two
    defects are worth naming because they are easy to reintroduce:

      ① FALSE CONTINUITY. It plotted one point per minute that HAPPENED to have
         activity and joined them, so 09:22 on Monday sat next to 10:34 on
         Thursday as if they were adjacent minutes. ⛔ That is not a time axis.
      ② 0/1 SAWTOOTH. Because only active minutes existed, every point was 1 and
         the gaps were invisible, so the y-axis read as on/off noise instead of
         a rate — the exact opposite of "identify system stress periods".

    THE FIX, and each part is load-bearing:
      * the axis covers EVERY bucket of the session window on EVERY day in range,
        so a quiet minute is a REAL ZERO and a busy one visibly spikes;
      * the line BREAKS between days — ⛔ no segment ever spans a date boundary;
      * the bucket width is chosen from the range so the chart keeps a readable
        number of points, and it is REPORTED (`bucket_min`) rather than implied;
      * the plotted value is EVENTS PER MINUTE (count ÷ bucket width), so the
        unit stays "per minute" whatever the bucket is. ⛔ Not a raw count, which
        would silently change meaning as the window grows.

    THREE INDEPENDENT CLOCKS, ⛔ never one series divided three ways: signals
    arrive whether or not an order follows, and an order is created whether or
    not it fills. Each is counted from its own timestamp, so
    Signals ≥ Created ≥ Filled emerges from the data instead of being imposed.

    ⚠️ The SIGNAL series is whole-population (SQL over `signals.received_at`)
    while the order series come from the FILTERED rows — stated on the panel,
    because a signal that produced no trade has no strategy to filter on.
