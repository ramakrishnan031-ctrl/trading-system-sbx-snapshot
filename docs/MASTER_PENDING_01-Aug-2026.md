# MASTER PENDING REGISTER — 01-Aug-2026 (Saturday, market closed)

> ## ⭐ THIS IS THE WORKING REGISTER. IT **SUPERSEDES** `MASTER_PENDING_28-Jul-2026.txt` AND `MASTER_PENDING_30-Jul-2026.md` AS THE THING YOU READ.
> ⛔ **IT DOES NOT REPLACE THEM AS AUTHORITIES.** Both are RETAINED, in the repo, and
> **cited by name on every item that came from them.** Delete neither. Where this file
> and a source disagree, **the source wins** and this file is the thing that is wrong.

**Why this file exists, in one sentence:** two thread-families are about to run in
parallel and will compete for attention — **(A)** the live-trading thread (Mon 3-Aug
observation → Tue 4-Aug flip → the carry pilot), which has **hard dates**, and **(B)**
the deferred-work threads (the audit's 12-item debt ledger, the ~105 open pre-audit
items, R1) — and without ONE register, starting the fix campaign buries the live gate,
or the live gate buries the fix campaign.

**Clock-read:** 01-Aug-2026, **Saturday**, session start **14:44 IST**. ~~Deployed SHA
`297b587`; `main` **21 ahead**, all docs-only, unpushed by design.~~

> # ▶️▶️ **RESUME — ~~WEDNESDAY 05-Aug CLOSED AT 23:4x~~ THURSDAY 06-Aug CLOSED AT 22:2x. ⭐ WRITTEN FOR A FRESH SESSION AT 08:30 WITH NO MEMORY OF LAST NIGHT.**
> **N = 233** *(231 → 232 A6, → 233 A7; A1 discharged to §D — reconciliation in §1)*. ⛔ **N UNCHANGED 06-Aug on BOTH axes — but the ROW-CANDIDATE SET is now SIX; if all are admitted N → 239. ⛔ RAMA'S RULING, not the thread's.** *(06-Aug evening addendum, below the close-out.)*
> 🚀 **~~DEPLOYED SHA `0197923`, UNMOVED. NOTHING FROM 05-Aug IS DEPLOYED.~~** ⇒ ✅ **SUPERSEDED 06-Aug 21:4x–22:2x: PUSHED `0197923 → 26b6ecb` (100 commits). `ahead 0`; PC == VM VERIFIED BY MD5, ⛔ not by `ahead 0`.** ⭐ **The behavioural surface was FOUR non-docs files and only TWO Python — `c5c1926` (`main.py`, proven **AST-IDENTICAL**) and `0087d3a`** — and **both first execute at FRIDAY 08:15 on an ordinary boot.**
> **AHEAD-COUNT — ⛔ BY COMMAND, NEVER FROM PROSE:** `git rev-list --count origin/main..main` → **0 at 22:27:13 IST 06-Aug** — ⭐ **the first zero of this campaign.** ⚠️ **It goes stale the moment anything is committed** *(the fixed point §A5 names)*. ⭐ **RE-RUN IT. Its authority is the memory ledger's top block, not this line.**
>
> ## 🔴 THE STATE, COLD — ⭐ **REWRITTEN 06-Aug 22:2x. The five facts below are FRIDAY's, not Wednesday's.**
> **1.** 🌙 **THE SERVICE IS DOWN, DELIBERATELY AND CLEANLY — stopped THURSDAY 20:32:19** on Rama's authorisation in his own words: `inactive · dead · Result=success · ExecMainStatus=0 · NRestarts=0`, still down at 104 s, and `token_watcher.log`'s last line is still **08:15:02** ⇒ **no start attempt.** ⇒ **FRIDAY's 08:15 boot is the ORDINARY path.** Record: `docs/audit/STOP_PROCEDURE_06-Aug-2026.md`.
> **2.** 🏁 **CLEAN IS *MEASURED*, NOT ASSUMED — ⛔ `ActiveState` ALONE IS NOT THE CHECK.** Shutdown window = **100 lines, ALL `INFO`** (zero ERROR/CRITICAL/WARNING) · `gtt_state` **unchanged** · both trades still `OPEN` with closure fields **empty** · **NO `RELEASE` row** · nothing written after 20:32. ⇒ **`_shutdown()` completed with a real CNC position AND A PHANTOM held — 2nd time ever, 1st with a phantom.**
> **3.** 🔴 **THE T+1 CARRY RAN END TO END — AND THE EXIT PATH IS BROKEN.** `cnc_gtt_monitor.py:464` `abs()` ⇒ `held=1` ⇒ the trade **never closes** and a GTT **respawns**. ⭐ **The book holds TWO positions and ONE OF THEM DOES NOT EXIST:** DIFFNKG = a **real** carry (`330658430 → trd_010f8e21…`), ATULAUTO = a **PHANTOM** (`330657774 → trd_e66ee17b…`). ⛔ **DO NOT MANUALLY BUY ATULAUTO while that GTT rests** — the system cannot re-enter, so a manual buy is the only path by which the stale sell fires on real shares.
> **4.** 💰 **AND THE PHANTOM'S LOSS IS MISSING FROM THE DAY'S BOOKS.** Reported **−7.20 gross**; real **≈−19.10** ⇒ ⭐ **the error is 165 % of the reported figure**, and it feeds the daily-loss limit, the 483-trade expectancy corpus and strategy win-rate. ⛔ **Not a display problem.** *(`docs/audit/eod_email_findings_06aug2026.md`.)*
> **5.** 🔑 **THE KILL IS `SOFT_KILL` (`circuit_breaker_force_close_15:15`) AND FRIDAY'S BOOT CLEARS IT.** **(S)** both clearers are **boot-only** (`main.py:1914`/`:1919`) ⇒ **no boot ⇒ no entries all day**; ✅ **the boot DOES clear it and it ignores open positions — proven by Thursday's own `08:15:02.876` auto-clear line.** ⇒ 🌙 **A MANUAL STOP IS NOW REQUIRED EVERY TRADING NIGHT UNTIL F6 LANDS** — ⚠️ **a missed FRIDAY stop costs MONDAY**, silently, presenting as *"no signals today"*.
>
> ## 🔴🔴 THE ONE THING OWED FRIDAY — **THE FREE MEASUREMENT, AND IT DECIDES AN OPERATIONAL BURDEN**
> ➡️ **START AT `docs/audit/FRIDAY_MORNING_07-Aug-2026.md`** — ⛔ one screen, and **the ATULAUTO DO-NOT is at the very top.**
> ⭐⭐ **AT THE FIRST MONITOR CYCLE AFTER BOOT, COMPARE ALL THREE VIEWS BEFORE ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION:** **broker truth · reservation replay · internal state.** ✅ **All three agree ⇒ expected.** 🔴 **They DIVERGE ⇒ DIAGNOSE BEFORE REMEDIATING.** ⛔ The `−1` row is **one input**, not the question.
> | outcome | ⇒ |
> |---|---|
> | ATULAUTO's CNC `−1` row **GONE** | `held = 0` ⇒ branch 4 fires ⇒ trade closes · **₹587.40 released** · GTT deleted · slot freed · ⭐ **the nightly-stop obligation ENDS** |
> | it **SURVIVES** | `abs()` ⇒ `held = 1` ⇒ `healthy:ATULAUTO`, nothing changes ⇒ ⛔ **the obligation stands INDEFINITELY** |
> ⭐⭐ **It settles a broker-behaviour fact nobody could establish from source, and it decides how urgent F6's build is.** ⛔ **Record it either way. DO NOT act on it.**
> 💰 **The boot replays ₹1,033.50** — ATULAUTO **₹587.40** (`ee9af41eae554c35`, the phantom) + DIFFNKG **₹446.10** (`0184b66d4c214416`). ⛔ **KEY ON `reservation_id`, NEVER `trade_id`** — only 1.9 % of `fm_ledger` rows carry one, so a `trade_id` query returns EMPTY and reads as *"capital released"*: **a certain false alarm on the one morning it matters.**
> ⚠️ **AND CHECK THE TOKEN FILE FIRST** — a failed 08:15 refresh is **SILENT** (no token ⇒ no watcher start ⇒ no boot, no error, no alert).
>
> ⛔ **STANDING:** ✅ **the push is DONE (`ahead 0`, PC == VM by md5)** · **no code changed 06-Aug except the two Python commits that rode the push**, one of them **AST-IDENTICAL** · **no implementation authorised** (needs evidence CONFIRMED **and** Rama's approval in his own words) · ⛔ **THE SIZING THREAD IS FROZEN** (values · YAML keys · code · the inventory-authority and pipeline-ownership rulings) · ⛔ **six row candidates await Rama; N stays 233.**
>
> ## 🔄 CURRENCY BLOCK — **BROUGHT CURRENT 04-Aug-2026 ~23:xx IST · ⭐ RE-MEASURED 05-Aug-2026 00:15 IST (the clock was READ, not recalled — `date` on the PC, offset `+0530`, cross-checked against `date -u`) · ⭐⭐ BROUGHT CURRENT AGAIN 05-Aug-2026 POST-BOOT — see the BOOT PASS below.** ⛔ THE FILENAME STILL SAYS 01-AUG AND MUST NOT BE RENAMED — it is cited by SHA-pinned references across the audit records. **The date in the title is the file's IDENTITY, not its currency; this block is its currency.**
>
> **STATE:** deployed SHA **`0197923`** — ⛔ **UNCHANGED; NOTHING FROM TONIGHT IS DEPLOYED.** ~~**PC == origin == VM bare** · **ahead 0** · `main` **clear**~~ ~~⭐ **SUPERSEDED (§G4), MEASURED 05-Aug 00:15: `main` is AHEAD 5 of `origin/main` (`0197923`); tree clean.**~~ ⭐⭐ **SUPERSEDED AGAIN (§G4), RE-MEASURED 05-Aug POST-BOOT: `main` is AHEAD 6 — `git rev-list --count origin/main..main` = 6, `origin/main` = `0197923ecb4954…`, `HEAD` = `e64146f…`, tree CLEAN.** ⛔ **"AHEAD 5" WAS NEVER WRONG AND IS NOW STALE — it was written INSIDE the commit that made it 6 (`e64146f`, 00:32:43), which is the fixed-point §A5 already names for `4603b75`: a count written in prose cannot include the commit that writes it.** The old counts are struck rather than edited in place because **an ahead-count written in prose ROTS**; the memory ledger's top block is its authority, not this line. *(`origin/main` measured directly; **the VM bare repo was NOT re-measured post-boot from here** — the 07:49–07:54 read-only VM control recorded in the memory ledger measured it at `0197923ecb4954…` == origin, and that is the citation, not an inference.)*
> ⛔ **AND A SECOND PREMISE CORRECTED, because it was about to send a commit through twice: *"last night's register update was left uncommitted"* is FALSE.** `e64146f` **is** that update (`docs/MASTER_PENDING_01-Aug-2026.md`, +55/−15, 05-Aug 00:32:43 +0530) and the working tree is clean. **The register was committed; only the PUSH did not happen** — which is the whole content of the timing correction below, and conflating the two would have manufactured a duplicate commit for work already in history.
> ⛔⛔ **AND THE TIMING PREMISE THAT EVERY ONE OF TONIGHT'S FOUR COMMIT MESSAGES CARRIES IS NOW REFUTED BY THE CLOCK — recorded here because it is the kind of claim that silently ages into a lie.** All four say *"everything committed tonight first executes WED 08:15 — flip morning."* **That was written at 23:35–23:37 on TUE 4-Aug, when a same-night push was still possible. It is now 00:15 on WED 5-Aug and the push did not happen** ⇒ **the VM boots `0197923` at 08:15 and NONE of the four is on it.** ⇒ ⭐ **the flip morning the operator watches runs the SAME code the 04-Aug census ran** — which is, on its own terms, the *conservative* outcome (flip day gains no new variables), but it is **not what the commit bodies claim**, and §A5 now carries the corrected first-execution date per commit.
> ✅✅ **THE FLIP IS `<DEPLOYED>` — ⛔ NOT `<VERIFIED LIVE>`.** Pushed **04-Aug 19:08:09** (`4149263..0197923`, 27 commits). **The flags first LOAD at WED 05-AUG 08:15**, because the service self-exited 17:35 and does not restart. **Delivery is `<VERIFIED LIVE>` only when a real CNC order and its GTT appear at the broker.**
>
> ### ⭐⭐ THE 05-AUG BOOT PASS — **THE FLIP IS NO LONGER "DEPLOYED, NOT VERIFIED". IT IS `<DEPLOYED — CAPABILITY VERIFIED LIVE, OUTCOME UNVERIFIED>`, AND THAT COMPOUND LABEL IS THE HONEST ONE.**
> **(1) ⭐ CAUSE (b) IS CLOSED.** `data_store/session/zerodha_token.json` present **08:15:01.910**, `date: 2026-08-05`; service **`active` 08:15:05**, `NRestarts=0`. ⇒ **"the service never started" is eliminated as an explanation for anything observed today** — the pre-boot observation order (memory ledger, step 1 before step 4) discharged as written. ⛔ **Without this step "the flip failed" and "the service never started" are INDISTINGUISHABLE, and no amount of later evidence separates them.**
> ⭐ **AND THE CHAIN IS PROVEN BY THE ORDERING, NOT BY THE CLOCK:** token at `:01.910` → service at `:05` is a **3.1 s gap inside a 30 s poll** (§3 below). Two events at plausible times prove nothing; **token-strictly-before-service, by less than one poll interval, is the evidence.**
> **(2) BOOT CHECKS.** composition **OK 62/62, UNMOVED** · **zero** migration lines (the evening-schema-push hazard did not apply, as §A2 predicted) · **one** CRITICAL = the known auto-cleared kill pair (`expected_alarms` §1b) · startup checks clean · **book flat**.
> ⚠️ **THE 18:00 DRIFT WARNING IS "NOT DUE", NOT "PASSED" — and the distinction is not pedantry.** At 08:15 the 18:00 job has not run; **absence at boot is not evidence about it.** `71f331b`'s registry half is tested **tonight at 18:00**, not this morning. ⛔ Recording it as "passed" would bank a green that could not have been red (§"a green check is evidence ONLY if it could have been red").
> **(3) CAPITAL AT BOOT.** `broker.net` **₹9,883.70** · `intraday_avail` **₹6,918.59** · `positional_avail` **₹2,965.11** *(70/30, and the positional bucket is now a bucket that can actually be spent)*.
>
> ### ⭐⭐⭐ THE HEADLINE — **THE NO-OP-FLIP RISK IS REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT, NOT BY REASONING**
> `strategy_control.summary` → **`will_trade_count: 15`, INCLUDING ALL THREE POSITIONAL STRATEGIES**; `wont_trade_count: 1` (`pb01`, unrelated). **Yesterday 723/723 STRATEGY_CONTROL rejections were LAYER 0 with LAYER 1 MASKED** (§25 above) ⇒ **the masked layer is now demonstrably satisfied, which is exactly the thing that could not be observed while LAYER 0 returned first.**
> ⭐ **WHY THIS IS A REFUTATION AND NOT MERELY A SUGGESTIVE LOG — re-measured at HEAD:** `main.py:2808-2816` calls **`strategies.control.strategy_will_trade`**, and its own comment says *"same resolver the entry gate + status table use"*. ⛔ **It is not a parallel reimplementation that could agree by accident** — the boot summary and the live entry gate are the same function, so a `will_trade` at boot is the gate's own answer. *(LAYER 0 `strategies/control.py:90`, LAYER 1 `:100` — ⭐ **both line numbers RE-MEASURED AT HEAD `e64146f` and both HOLD**, per §M3.)*
> ⛔⛔ **BUT `will_trade` IS A PERMISSION, NOT AN ORDER — AND THIS IS THE LOAD-BEARING QUALIFICATION.** Between permission and a filled CNC order sit **screening · sizing · the R:R gate · affordability**, none of which has ever run for a positional entry in production. ⇒ ⭐ **THE CAPABILITY IS PROVEN; THE OUTCOME IS NOT.** ⛔ **NOT `<VERIFIED LIVE>`** — that label still requires a real CNC order and its GTT at the broker (§A2).
>
> ### ✅⭐⭐⭐ **AND THEN IT TRADED — (a) IS ANSWERED THE SAME DAY. TWO CNC POSITIONS ARE HELD.**
> **The morning's `will_trade` permission became a FILLED DELIVERY POSITION: screening · sizing · affordability · placement · fill ALL cleared.** ⇒ **§A2 is `<DEPLOYED — ENTRY PATH VERIFIED LIVE 05-Aug; EXIT PATH UNVERIFIED>`** — ⛔ **not a blanket `<VERIFIED LIVE>` for delivery: the GTT trigger, T+1 and the carry are untouched.** ⚠️ **OPERATOR-REPORTED, ⛔ NOT MEASURED FROM HERE** *(the PC's DB copy is mtime **03-Aug 16:08** — it predates the flip push and the boot and cannot hold today's rows)*; **the measurements owed tonight, and the reason the confirmation quantity is TODAY'S TOTAL CNC VALUE rather than symbol names, are in §A2 (a).**
> 🔴🔴 **AND THE CONSEQUENCE THAT CHANGES TONIGHT'S WORK: §C.5's CHECK1 GATE IS NOW MANDATORY, NOT CONTINGENT** — there IS a held CNC position, so the branch that made the gate hypothetical is gone. ⛔ **"The GTT passed at Zerodha" is NOT the claim CHECK1 reads** (re-measured at HEAD — it skips on an **`ACTIVE` `gtt_state` row keyed to the trade's `trade_id`**, `order_reconciler.py:871-872`). ⇒ **§C.5, first row.** ⭐ **And H1 + H5 stop being "live from the first fill" and become LIVE — §B#7.**
>
> ### ⭐⭐ THE FINDING INSIDE THE HEADLINE — **IT GENERALISES, AND IT IS THE MORE VALUABLE HALF**
> `delivery_lock.status` (`main.py:2838-2846`) publishes the system's **OWN COMPOSITE VERDICT** — `cnc_orders_possible: true` — with a `note` that names the full conjunct **verbatim**: *"real CNC/GTT requires `delivery_enabled=true` AND `force_intraday_only=false` AND `trade_type` in {DELIVERY,BOTH}"*. ⇒ ⭐⭐ **THE 04-AUG "FLAG NOBODY LISTED" (`trade_type`, §25) WAS IN THE BOOT LOG THE WHOLE TIME.** The flag list was short; **the system was not.**
> ⭐ **THE LESSON, REGISTERED AS A LESSON AND NOT ONLY AS A FACT: THIS SYSTEM PUBLISHES COMPOSITE ASSERTIONS THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN DERIVING BY HAND.** Reading a published verdict is **cheaper AND more authoritative** than re-deriving one — cheaper because it is one grep, more authoritative because it is emitted by the code that enforces it, so it cannot drift from the enforcement the way a hand-derived list can. ⇒ 🔴 **LOOK FOR THE OTHERS.** Known members already: `delivery_lock.status` · `strategy_control.summary` · the composition census · `config_auditor`'s `will_trade_count`. ⛔ **This does NOT retire hand-derivation** — a published verdict is only as good as its predicate, and §M6's rule still applies: **a verdict emitted BELOW an earlier-returning guard measures the guard above it.** *(⚠️ M5 — what this does not cover: no sweep for further composite emitters was run; the four named are the ones encountered, not an enumeration.)*
> ⭐ **WED 5-AUG IS THE FLIP DAY, NOT TUE 4-AUG — and the reason, so a later reader sees a DECISION and not drift: R2 (Option Y), ratified 02-Aug.** 4-Aug was **reassigned, not deleted**: shakedown day + the first real EOD census, then the flip-flag push that evening. **Every dated "4-Aug flip" reference in this file means 5-Aug, by R2.**
> **WHAT THE FLIP ACTUALLY CHANGED (3 value lines + 2 registry states + their prose):** `force_intraday_only: true→false` · **`trade_type: INTRADAY→BOTH`** · `delivery_enabled: false→true` · `cnc_gtt_placer`/`cnc_gtt_monitor` `expected-dormant→expected-event-driven`. ⛔ **NOT** `conditional_allocation_enabled` (R10 — measured a no-op under BOTH) and ⛔ **NOT** `allocator_mode` (its own gate).
> ⭐⭐ **`trade_type` WAS MISSING FROM THE FLAG LIST AND IS LOAD-BEARING — §G5's FOURTH instance (#6 · #5 · D4 · here): the flip's INTENT was ruled and STANDS; its MECHANISM was incomplete.** `control.py:90` (LAYER 0) returns **before** `:100` (LAYER 1) is reached ⇒ measured live 04-Aug, **723/723** STRATEGY_CONTROL rejections were LAYER 0 and **ZERO** were LAYER 1. ⛔ **That zero was not evidence LAYER 1 was satisfied — it was evidence LAYER 0 MASKED it.** Flipping the other two alone would have produced **a flip that looked complete and changed nothing.** ⛔ **R2 is NOT overturned, questioned or weakened.**
> ⭐ **THE REUSABLE LESSON: a zero from a guard sitting BELOW an earlier-returning guard measures the guard ABOVE it, not itself.** Third instance of this shape in the campaign (with §M6 and the drift ladder's 09:15-only feed).
> **THE FLIP TURNS ON EXACTLY 3 STRATEGIES:** `positional_momentum_long` · `positional_sector_rotation` · `positional_swing_long` — the only DELIVERY-intent entries, all enabled, all LONG, **all declaring `order_protocol: LIMIT_TRIPLE`.** ⭐ That last fact is the **structural** half of why #2d rides safely (the flip cannot un-dormant CO through the strategies it enables); the **measured** half is the census reading `co_protocol: acted 0`.
> ✅ **THE FIRST REAL EOD CENSUS RAN AND IS CLEAN** (`BEGIN day=2026-08-04 mode=live entries=70` … `END mismatches=0`): **22 dormant anchors at 0** · known-acting >0 (`kill_switch 1` traced to the real 15:15 SOFT_KILL, `fund_manager 79`) ⇒ counters are **not dead-by-construction** · MISMATCH block **empty** · 8 NEVER-CONSTRUCTED `[expected]`. **Reconciles on both axes:** 52 block entries + 18 inline `infra` = 70; 70 − 8 expected-absent = **62** = the boot's `composition OK 62/62`. **GATE-Q3 checked, not waved: today TRADED, so a money-path zero WOULD have been a finding; none were zero.**
> ⚠️ **M5 — WHAT THIS BLOCK DOES NOT COVER:** it records state and the 04-Aug measurements. It does **not** re-derive §B/§C item counts (**231 stands**), does not re-measure any pre-04-Aug finding, and adds **no new register rows** — every 04-Aug finding below is a sub-entry or scope expansion on an existing row.

**Method:** ⛔ **CONSOLIDATION ONLY. Nothing was re-derived; every item cites the
register/phase it came from.** No code, config, DB, service or live sequence was touched
in producing this. Findings are **cited, not re-measured** — the audit measured them on
01-Aug against `297b587` and that measurement is not repeated here.

# 🔴🔴 06-AUG-2026 CLOSE-OUT — **THE FIRST T+1 DELIVERY EXIT, AND THE DEFECT IT EXPOSED.** ⛔ **N STAYS 233 — see the row question below.**

> ⛔ **EVERY ITEM IS A POINTER TO A COMMITTED RECORD.** Primary:
> **`docs/design/f6_delivery_exit_predicate_design_06aug2026.md`** (§§1–15, four commits).
> Also: `docs/05_incident_response.md` (P0 GTT rule) · `foundation_engineering_rules.md` §1.11,
> §1.12 · `campaign_practices.md` AR9 second scope correction · `04_db_schema_reference.md`
> (the Phase E ordering blocker).
> 🏷️ **M9 classes on every claim. ⛔ No symbol names — totals only.**

**✅ WHAT WORKED, RECORDED FIRST:** the delivery lifecycle ran **end to end in production** —
entry → GTT → overnight carry → clean shutdown → fresh 08:15 boot → T+1 → GTT trigger → exit.
**(P)** A same-day round trip also closed **cleanly**: four views converging inside **2 ms**, with
the reservation **and** realised P&L returned in one row. ⭐ **That trace is adopted as the GOLDEN
REFERENCE fixture for every future delivery change.**

**🔴 THE DEFECT (LIVE, capital path).** `cnc_gtt_monitor.py:464` takes `abs()` of a same-day CNC
position quantity. On a **T+1 exit** the sale is already reflected in `holdings()`, so adding the
`−1` position **double-counts it** and `held` becomes 1. **(S)** `held == 0` is the **sole** door
to `_finalize_gtt_exit` ⇒ **one line produces BOTH symptoms**: the trade never closes **and** a
new GTT spawns every cycle. **(P)** md5-identical at the VM, `0197923` and HEAD — established by
**file identity**, because the VM is not a git checkout.
⭐ **Bracketed both ways:** a negative control (05-Aug, no F6) and a positive control (06-Aug clean
exit) — **the defect is exactly one row of the truth table wide, and reachable ONLY on a T+1 exit.**
⚠️ **Cost:** the reservation is stranded and **replayed at every 08:15 boot** — ~21 % of the
delivery bucket, daily, for a position that does not exist. ⛔ **No supported closure path exists**
(§1.12).

**🔴 THE SAFETY FINDING, and it is the one that outranks F6 in the long run.** **(S)** `_check7`
publishes `source_module="fund_manager_self_check"` — **IN `_ESCALATING_SOURCES`** ⇒ **DH1 does
NOT bar it** ⇒ single-sample SOFT/HARD escalation. Its ledger read is **blind to `RELEASE_USED`**
(0 of 220 carry `reservation_id`; `RELEASE` carries it 1189 of 1189 — **perfectly disjoint keys**).
⇒ **HARD ORDERING CONSTRAINT: `reservation_id` on `RELEASE_USED` must land BEFORE Phase E.**

**⚠️ THREE PROCESS FAILURES, all self-caught, all recorded:**
1. **A bridge instruction steered a measurement wrong** — *"key on `reservation_id`, not
   `trade_id`"* is **backwards for `RELEASE_USED`**. It did not merely fail to catch the blind
   query; **it instructed it.** *(Proof A withdrawn; Proof B — the ledger's running balance, using
   no key at all — carries the conclusion alone and reconciles to the paisa at every step.)*
2. **A scoped result was silently generalised** — AR9 covers G3 (`order_reconciler`, barred by
   DH1), **not** `_check7` (`fund_manager_self_check`, not barred). **Two checks, one file, one
   alarm name, two safety postures.** ⭐ Caught only by measuring the tag at source.
3. **A stale docstring on a kill-path gate** — `drift_handler.py:17` says the escalating set has
   **one** member; the frozenset four lines below has **three**. **The prose says barred; the code
   says escalates.** ⛔ **Filed separately; not fixed in passing.**

**📌 THE ROW QUESTION — ⛔ OWED TO RAMA, NOT TAKEN HERE.** Three candidates: the **F6 predicate
defect**, the **DH1 doc/code divergence**, and the **absent operator recovery path**. The
`RELEASE_USED` key gap is **NOT** a candidate — it is already on record (E4, 17-Jul) and today only
established its **live consequences**. ⇒ **If all three are admitted, N 233 → 236.** ⛔ **N STAYS
233 until ruled.** ⭐ Recorded this way because N is a governed number and today's thread had no
authority to move it.

**⛔ BUILD NOT AUTHORISED. TONIGHT RULED OFF** by two independently sufficient reasons: exit
identity needs a new persisted marker ⇒ **schema**, and an **evening schema push** trips
`_refuse_migration` on every heartbeat cron until the next 08:15 boot. ⭐ **A deadline meetable
only by breaking a rule is a deadline that should be missed.**

## 🌙 06-AUG **EVENING** ADDENDUM *(20:00 → 22:2x)* — ⛔ **N STILL 233. THE CANDIDATE SET GREW 3 → 6.**

### ✅ OPERATIONAL — CLOSED TONIGHT, no row implications

- **THE STOP RAN CLEAN, and it is MEASURED not assumed.** **(P)** `inactive · dead · Result=success ·
  ExecMainStatus=0 · NRestarts=0`, ran 08:15:02 → **20:32:19**. **(P)** shutdown window = **100 lines,
  ALL `INFO`** — zero ERROR/CRITICAL/WARNING; `gtt_state` unchanged; both trades still `OPEN` with
  closure fields empty; **no `RELEASE` row**; nothing written after 20:32. ⇒ 🏁 **`_shutdown()`
  completed with a real CNC position AND A PHANTOM held — 2nd time ever, 1st with a phantom.**
- **CENSUS RECOVERED.** `BEGIN … entries=70` @20:32:15, 55 lines, `END … mismatches=0`.
  **(P)** `cnc_gtt_monitor: acted 50` (05-Aug: 24) — the expectation **scored, not refuted**.
  ⛔ **`acted` counts rows EXAMINED, not actions TAKEN.**
- **A5 — THE DEPLOY SLOT: `ahead 0`, `origin/main == 26b6ecb`, PC == VM verified by md5.**
  ⛔ **ROW NOT MOVED, deliberately.** It was discharged on 04-Aug and **re-opened the same night**;
  the row is the *ongoing discipline*, not a one-time state. ⭐ **Banking it would lose it.**

### 🔴 NEW MATERIAL — **THREE NEW ROW CANDIDATES. ⛔ NOT ADMITTED.**

| # | candidate | why it may be a row | why it may NOT be |
|---|---|---|---|
| **4** | 🔴🔴 **THE MEASUREMENT LAYER PUBLISHES NUMBERS IT CANNOT VOUCH FOR** *(F6 cost #7)* | **(P)** the day's P&L was **−7.20 gross reported vs ≈−19.10 real** — ATULAUTO's ≈₹11.90 loss is **ABSENT**, not mis-priced (`status=OPEN`, all closure fields empty). ⭐ **The error is 165 % of the reported figure**, and it feeds the daily-loss limit, the **483-trade expectancy corpus** and strategy win-rate | it is a **consequence** of the F6 predicate defect (candidate 1) and may be a sub-entry rather than a row |
| **5** | 🔴 **CLASSIFICATION LEAKAGE** — runtime vs business vs execution vs reporting state | ⭐⭐ **three of today's defects are one shape**: F6 (runtime→business), the tree diff (healthy→violation), `reconcile_positions` exit 2 (finding→execution failure). **One review may close several future cases** | it is **cross-cutting**, and the register may prefer it as a `§E` governance entry rather than a debt row |
| **6** | **A CHECK FOR AN ARTIFACT NOBODY PRODUCES** — `watchman.md` / `flow_trace.md` | **(S)** `system_manager.py:409-410` checks both; **repo-wide, all file types: NO producer for either**. Corroborated by the record — `SYSTEM_MAP:1293` logged the same MISSING lines 22/23/24-Jul | it is one line of a daily report; may be a **§C** housekeeping item, not a debt row |

> **⇒ IF ALL SIX ARE ADMITTED, N 233 → 239.** *(the earlier three: F6 predicate · DH1 doc/code
> divergence · absent operator recovery path.)* ⛔ **N STAYS 233 UNTIL RAMA RULES.**
> ⭐ **Same reason as this morning's block: N is a governed number and this thread had no authority
> to move it.** ⛔ **Do not read six candidates as six rows.**

### 📌 RECORDED, NOT CANDIDATES — no row sought

- **`reconcile_positions` exit 2 — BOTH PREMISES REFUTED; IT DID NOT FAIL.** **(S) `:428-434`**
  `has_mismatch ⇒ 2`, `has_error ⇒ 1` ⇒ **2 is a FINDING code.** **(P)** 38 runs = 33 SUCCESS/4
  FAILED/1 SKIPPED, with exit-2s on **29-Jul and 31-Jul — no T+1 holding** ⇒ ⛔ **not a T+1
  signature.** ⭐ The defect is the **heartbeat wrapper mapping any non-zero to `FAILED`** — folded
  into candidate 5, ⛔ not sought as its own row.
- **ALERT DEBT opened** (`expected_alarms.md` §10) — AD-1 the daily tree-diff CRITICAL *(an A7
  instance)*, AD-2 the exit-2 mapping. ⭐ **Each carries the condition that RETIRES it.**
- **THE NIGHTLY-STOP OBLIGATION + its RETIREMENT TEST** (F6 §15.1/§15.2/§15.3). ⭐ Written **now,
  while the workaround is new** — *"one authored by someone tired of the workaround is a different
  document."* 🏷️ **A temporary compensating control, ⛔ not steady-state design.**
- **SIZING — the recount, and it is a `M12` instance.** **(P)** the four existing delivery twins
  **ARE inside the 113** (`system_config.yaml:190·191·205·206`, neither family excluded) ⇒
  ⛔ **`31+34+6+42 = 113` RECONCILES BY ACCIDENT**: the DELIVERY-ONLY 6 **are not keys at all**
  (*"no key exists for any of them"*) and ≥4 real keys sit in **no bucket** — **two offsetting
  errors.** Classified existing = **107**. ⚠️ Residual 6 = 4 named + **2 UNIDENTIFIED**, inheriting
  the corpus's own ±1 (301 vs 302). **A 4th miscount found while recounting: the semantic filter's
  destination line accounts for 17 of 25 drops.** ⛔ **The last 2 unassigned (`risk_per_trade_pct` ·
  `max_position_value_pct`) are the PARENTS of two unclassified twins — their destination IS the
  twin-retirement RULING, owed to Rama.** ⛔ **No bucket percentage may be quoted until ruled.**

> ### 🔴 **07-Aug-2026 00:3x — THE RULING IS SHARPENED, ⛔ NOT REOPENED. Measured, not reasoned.**
> **The two twins are not awaiting keys — THEIR KEYS ALREADY EXIST**, as `null` placeholders:
> `config/system_config.yaml:190` `delivery_risk_per_trade_pct` · `:191`
> `delivery_max_position_value_pct`, under a `:185-189` comment that states the invitation in
> writing — *"The V3 delivery path sets these when delivery is activated (a later step)."*
> ⭐⭐ **SO THE RULING IS NOT "should these twins exist?" — IT IS "RETIRE TWO KEYS THAT ALREADY
> EXIST", which is a different act with a different risk.** ⛔ Retiring a written key is a config
> change with a deploy; declining to create one is free.
> 🔴 **AND THE INVITATION CREATED THE DECISION:** both are twins of controls the thread measured as
> **NEVER BINDING** (§5.2) ⇒ **the placeholders MANUFACTURED a ruling that would not otherwise be
> owed.** 🏷️ **Registered as the worked case under `G5.1`** *(`campaign_practices.md`)*.
> ⚠️ **A second cost is already latent, and it is Must-Land-Before constraint 8:**
> `capital/position_sizer.py:585` **enforces** `eff_max_position_value_pct` while `:596`/`:609`
> **report the GLOBAL** ⇒ **the moment `delivery_max_position_value_pct` is given a value, the
> operator-facing CRITICAL states a percentage that was NOT enforced.**
> ⛔ **This does NOT fire `(E)`** — it contradicts no registered conclusion and reverses no ruling;
> it **sharpens a ruling already owed.** ⭐ Recorded here so the ruling is taken against the real
> state rather than the assumed one.
>
> ### ⚠️⚠️ **AND THE HONEST PROVENANCE — `M8`, AND IT IS A GOVERNANCE-DEBT INSTANCE**
> ⛔ **This was NOT a discovery. THE DECISION LEDGER ALREADY HELD IT:** row **4**'s evidence cell,
> written 06-Aug evening, reads *"**(P)** both twins exist and are **`null`**"*. ⭐ **The record was
> right and the draft rule was wrong** — `G5.1`'s first draft asserted the step was *"one step
> away"*, and a `config/` grep then contradicted it.
> ⇒ 🏷️ **The failure was not a missing measurement. It was NOT READING THE RECORD** — the exact
> shape `M8` names, and the exact shape logged as governance debt *(a conclusion carried without
> the evidence set that produced it, so the next reader re-derives it)*.
> ⭐ **Worth more than the finding itself: the grep and the ledger AGREED, which is why this cost
> only a correction. Two sources that disagree are the expensive case.**
> ⚠️ **Row 4's `Reopen Trigger` cell remains `EMPTY` — ⛔ NOT filled here.** ⭐ It is one of the
> 8-of-9 empties that are the ledger's own first finding, and filling it is a ruling-adjacent act
> (`G5.1`).

### 🔢 THE COUNT — ⛔ **NOTHING MOVED. BOTH AXES RESTATED IN FULL ANYWAY**

*⭐ Per this file's own rule — **silence about a count is how it rots** — and per `M12`: a numbered

| **4** | **The TWO TWIN PARENTS** — retire `delivery_risk_per_trade_pct` / `delivery_max_position_value_pct`, or keep them? | `[ENG]` | **(P)** both twins exist and are **`null`**; **(P)** neither parent has **ever** bound — `binding_constraint='concentration'` on **483/483**, zero `REJECTED_SIZING_RISK`; the 1:1 rule **rejects both** | the last **2 of §6's 8** unassigned drops cannot be placed; the sizing partition stays unclosed | ⚠️ **EMPTY** | 06-Aug, `dependency_map` §1.3 |

# ✅ §R — **THE TWO RULINGS TAKEN, 07-Aug-2026 · DECIDER: RAMA**

## §R.1 · RULING 1 — CONTROL-INVENTORY AUTHORITY · **TAKEN 07-Aug-2026 · Rama** · ledger row **1**

**DECISION.** `ops_dashboard/docs/G2a_capacity_inventory.md` **is the authority** — the single source
of truth for the control inventory. The 27-row inventory at `docs/audit/audit_05jul2026.md:527` is
**SUPERSEDED**: frozen, historical, never updated again. The 113-key config review
(`docs/design/sizing/config_surface_review_06aug2026.md`) is **MERGED INTO** the authority and does
not survive as a separate document. Joined on the **dotted config key**. ⛔ **Location NOT decided** —
the file stays under `ops_dashboard/docs/`; moving it breaks `capacity.py`'s consumer and is its own
card on its own day.

**AUTHORITY:** Rama. **DATE/VERSION:** 07-Aug-2026, against repo HEAD `612a06b`.
**RESIDUAL RISK:** a system-wide authority lives in a subsystem folder — accepted, named, and
carried as a wart rather than smoothed away.
**REOPEN TRIGGER:** ⭐ *(this row has one, deliberately — 8 of 9 ledger rows did not, and that
emptiness was the ledger's own first finding)* — **a review whose finding cannot be expressed as a
change to a row in the authority.** That is the signal the row schema is wrong, and it is the only
condition under which a second inventory is reconsidered.

**EXECUTED (docs only, `98e7406` + `612a06b`):** authority header · one-line superseded pointer ·
the merge, `30 + 14 = 44` rows, with five collision classes recorded.

## §R.2 · RULING 2 — SHARED SYMBOL NAMESPACE, TIGHTENED · **TAKEN 07-Aug-2026 · Rama** · ledger row **2**

**RAMA'S DECISION, VERBATIM — this text governs; everything below it is commentary:**

> "One symbol may have only ONE SIMULTANEOUS OPEN position across the entire account."
>
> "If any open position already exists for a symbol, every new entry for that symbol is rejected.
> When that position is completely closed and no open position exists anymore, the symbol
> immediately becomes eligible again for every pipeline. The next entry is evaluated from the
> current account state, not from historical ownership."
>
> Delivery holding sold at 11:50, no position remains  → MIS may enter at 11:51.
> MIS exits first                                      → Delivery may enter after.
> Delivery open + MIS entry together                   → reject.
> MIS open + Delivery entry together                   → reject.

**THE GATE REDUCES TO ONE QUESTION:** does an **OPEN** position currently exist for this symbol?
**YES → reject. NO → proceed to normal eligibility checks.**
**The rule is PIPELINE-INDEPENDENT.** MIS / CNC / GTT / delivery is irrelevant to it. This is
deliberate: **it is business policy, and implementation derives from the policy, never the reverse.**

**AUTHORITY:** Rama. **DATE/VERSION:** 07-Aug-2026. **Chose option (b), then tightened it.**

### 🔴 §R.2a — THE THREE CONSEQUENCES, RECORDED SO NO FUTURE READER BELIEVES THIS RULING WAS FREE

Option (b) *as originally offered* blessed the current behaviour and cost zero code. The tightened
version does not. Recorded as commissioned, each with the measurement that tested it:

| # | consequence as stated when the ruling was recorded | measured verdict, 07-Aug |
|---|---|---|
| **(i)** | *"it is a real behaviour change requiring real code"* | 🔴 **HALF REFUTED.** It **is** a real behaviour change — 🔴 **9 entries on 2 days across 4 symbols** would have been permitted that the live gates blocked (**(P)**, §H6). But it requires **no code**: the blocking gate is `risk.one_trade_per_symbol_direction_per_day`, and setting it **`false`** restores a **byte-identical** pre-27-Jul path by the code's own docstring. ⭐ **The cost is a POLICY cost, not an engineering one — and that is a bigger difference than it sounds** |
| **(ii)** | *"it LOOSENS an existing protection, and the campaign carries a standing caution against loosening gates"* | ✅ **STANDS, and is NOT softened.** The caution is aimed at loosening to make numbers look better; **this loosening is for a defensible policy reason — but the direction is the same and it is named as such.** ⚠️ **What is being loosened has a named incident behind it:** the gate exists because of SENCO, 27-Jul — exited TGT 10:13:31 @425.05, **re-entered 80 seconds later @425.25**, *above* the price its own strategy had just taken profit at, then stopped out for −4.86, **giving back 83 % of the first trade's gain** (`signal_processor.py:681-687`). ⛔ **Ruling 2 as written re-admits exactly that trade** |
| **(iii)** | *"the claim that Ruling 2 retires one of F6's seven costs is NOT established and may be false"* | 🔴 **CONFIRMED — it is false, and in the more dangerous direction.** Ruling 2 does not retire an F6 cost; **F6 makes Ruling 2 UNIMPLEMENTABLE CORRECTLY.** The rule's predicate is *"is a position open right now"*, the only product-blind source of that is `trades.status`, and F6 is precisely what stops a delivery trade ever leaving `OPEN`. See §H5 of the verification report |

### §R.2b — THE ACCEPTED TRADE-OFF, RECORDED EXPLICITLY *(§2.3)*

**Overlapping exposure in a single symbol is now an INTENTIONAL PORTFOLIO-RISK CONSTRAINT.**
⛔ It is no longer an accidental limitation inherited from the code. Concretely, and accepted:

- **Concentration is capped by policy, not only by `max_concentration_pct`.** A symbol can never be
  held twice, so single-name exposure cannot be stacked by two pipelines arriving independently.
- **The cost of that is a foregone trade.** When delivery holds a name the intraday scanner likes,
  the intraday entry is refused — and it is refused *because we chose to*, not because a gate
  happened to be product-blind.
- **The benefit is that exit attribution stays unambiguous.** Two positions in one symbol at one
  broker net into one line; the reverse-aware flatten paths, the oversell guards and the GTT
  adoption logic all key on `(symbol)` or `(symbol, product)` and **PAPER NETS BY SYMBOL WHILE LIVE
  KITE NETS PER (SYMBOL, PRODUCT)** — so a two-position book is a shape paper can never rehearse.
  ⭐ **The ruling makes a whole class of paper/live divergence unreachable by policy.**

**RESIDUAL RISK:** the loosening half re-admits the SENCO trade class (consequence ii).
**REOPEN TRIGGER:** ⭐ **a same-day re-entry, permitted by this ruling, that closes worse than the
exit that preceded it — twice.** *(One is noise; the SENCO incident was a single observation and the
gate built on it is the thing now being loosened, so the bar is deliberately set at two.)*

### §R.2c — ⛔ WHAT IS **NOT** AUTHORISED BY THIS RECORD

⛔ No gate changed · ⛔ no predicate rewritten · ⛔ no config key flipped · ⛔ no schema · ⛔ no F6
fix · ⛔ F6's retirement checklist **not edited** (see §2.4 in the design doc). Recording a ruling is
not authorising its build. **Gate 2 — Rama's authorisation in his own words for a build — has not
been given, and nothing here supplies it.**

## 🔴 THE LEDGER TESTED AGAINST ITS OWN CRITERION — **and it went RED on one of two rows**

> **THE CRITERION:** *"Would a NEW reviewer reach the SAME conclusion using ONLY the ledger?"*
> ⭐ **Testable tonight rather than aspirational, because the ledger now exists.** Two rows read
> cold — ⛔ deliberately the **hardest** and the **easiest**.

| row | verdict | |
|---|---|---|
| **#5 · `watchman`/`flow_trace`** `[PREF]` | ✅ **REACHABLE FROM THE ROW ALONE** | it carries the checker's exact site (`system_manager.py:409-410`), the absence **with its search width stated** *(repo-wide, all file types)*, independent corroboration *(`SYSTEM_MAP:1293`, the same MISSING lines on 22/23/24-Jul)*, and the history *(never scheduled, 11 manual runs)*. ⭐ **A reviewer can rule *retire* or *restore* without opening anything.** |
| **#2 · the three symbol gates** `[ENG]` | 🔴 **NOT REACHABLE — the row is INCOMPLETE** | it says *"(S) three gates, not one"* but ⛔ **never NAMES them, never cites their sites, and omits the two facts that decide the ruling.** |

### 🔴 THE MISSING FACTS ON ROW #2, NAMED PRECISELY *(as §3.2 requires)*

⛔ **A reviewer must open `delivery_config_surface_06aug2026.md` §7.1 to learn:**
1. **the three gates are** `SYMBOL_DIRECTION_DAILY_LIMIT` (`signal_processor.py:717`) ·
   **`DUPLICATE_SYMBOL`** (`risk_engine.py:688-693`) · `CONTRARY_POSITION` (`risk_engine.py:~680`);
2. ⭐⭐ **two of the three NEVER EXPIRE** — gate 1 clears at midnight, **gates 2 and 3 do not clear at
   all**; and
3. ⭐⭐⭐ **none can be made product-aware without a join that does not exist** — there is **no
   `trades.product` column**; product lives on `orders`, reachable only via `LEFT JOIN … leg='ENTRY'`.
   ⇒ 🏷️ **The ruling is STRUCTURAL, not a config choice** — and the row as written implies the opposite.

### ⭐⭐ THE GAP SHAPE — **A MISSING COLUMN, NOT A PER-ROW DEFECT** *(§3.3's question, answered)*

**The `[PREF]` row passed and the `[ENG]` row failed, and that is the pattern:**
> **A PREFERENCE ruling needs only the FACTS. An ENGINEERING ruling also needs THE SURFACE A RULING
> WOULD TOUCH** — *what would have to change, and whether it is a value, a code path, or a schema.*
⇒ 🔴 **THE LEDGER IS MISSING A COLUMN: `WHAT A RULING WOULD TOUCH`.**
⭐ **That is the ledger's SECOND useful output, after the eight empty reopen-trigger cells** — and it
is a **structural** finding rather than a note to fix row #2.
⛔ **DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED TONIGHT** *(§3.3)*: two rows tested, the pattern recorded. ⭐ **Fixing all
nine now would have hidden whether it was per-row or systemic — and it is systemic.**

⚠️ **NUMBERING NOTE, so a later reader is not misled:** the commissioning card refers to
*"#8, `watchman`/`flow_trace`"* using **its own §5 list order**; in this ledger that item is **row 5**,
because the table is **ordered by what each ruling BLOCKS, not by age.** ⛔ **Cite rows by NAME, not
by number, across documents.**

## 📋 THE ROW SCHEMA — **TIER A mandatory · TIER B earned** *(adopted 06-Aug)*

🏷️ **Parent (G7): extends this ledger's own schema.**

| tier | fields | when |
|---|---|---|
| **A — MANDATORY** | **owner · purpose · evidence expiry** *(on decisions)* · **semantic correctness** *(on partitions)* | always |
| **B — ACTIVATED ONLY ON REPEATED CROSS-CATEGORY EVIDENCE** | authority · update path · validation point · retirement trigger | ⛔ not by default |

⭐ **Proportional now, expandable when earned** — ⛔ a schema that demands eight fields on day one is
abandoned by week two.
⚠️ **AND THE HONEST NOTE, because the stricter bar catches one of our own:** promotion is meant to
require **recurrence AND cross-category value**, and **"semantic correctness" has ONE instance in ONE
artifact class.** ⭐⭐ **It survives only because it was FOLDED INTO `M12` as a clause rather than
promoted as a rule — so it never had to clear the bar.** 🏷️ **The fold was right before there was a
reason for it; `G7` is that reason, arriving afterwards.**

# 🔒 THE **MUST-LAND-BEFORE** TABLE — every ordering constraint in one place *(built 06-Aug-2026)*

> ⭐⭐ **WHY THIS EXISTS:** the register already contained several ordering constraints, **each
> discovered independently and each living inside the row that found it.** ⛔ **An ordering rule that
> lives only inside one row is INVISIBLE to the refactor that violates it.**

### ⚠️ SWEEP WIDTH AND ITS LIMIT — ⛔ **READ BEFORE TRUSTING THIS TABLE**
**Corpus:** `MASTER_PENDING_01-Aug-2026.md` (2024 lines) · `campaign_practices.md` ·
`foundation_engineering_rules.md` · all `docs/design/*.md`.
**Patterns (8):** `MUST LAND BEFORE` · `hard prerequisite` · `HARD ORDERING` · `must ship with` ·
`gated on` · `sequencing-critical` · `BEFORE item N` · `co-requirement`.
**Raw hits 21 ⇒ 8 distinct constraints, each read in full and verified.**

> 🔴🔴 **THIS TABLE IS NOT COMPLETE, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT.** The sweep is **phrase-based**:
> any constraint expressed without one of those eight phrases is **invisible to it**. `gated on`
> alone returned **10** hits not individually resolved. ⛔ **A "complete" ordering table that is not
> complete is more dangerous than none — it invites the reader to stop looking.**

### ⭐ THREE SHAPES, NOT ONE — the sweep's own finding

**SHAPE 1 · A BEFORE B** *(true ordering)*

| # | must land FIRST | blocks | ⚠️ the concrete failure if violated | recorded at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A4 — the buy-day product filter** (+CRITICAL-on-NULL) | **anything making the kill holdings-aware** | a HARD_KILL flatten reaches delivery shares the filter exists to spare | `:1032`, `:1159` |
| 2 | **`#2e`** — the local-pass flatten product filter | **A3, the carry pilot** *(Rama's ruling, 03-Aug ~10:30)* | **(P) measured:** `place_order('SYM','SELL',15,…)` on a `(MIS 10)+(CNC 5)` book ⇒ **5 shares come out of the delivery position** | `:1025` |
| 3 | **item 4** — the inventory reconciliation | **item 5** — the delivery config surface | any delivery value set first is exactly the *"blind settings"* being refused | `:794` |
| 4 | **D-3** — `reservation_id` on `RELEASE_USED` | **Phase E** orphan detection | a released reservation reports its **whole** margin held ⇒ spurious drift on a tag **DH1 does not bar** ⇒ **spurious kill** | `:143` · `04_db_schema_reference.md` · design §14.4 |
| 5 | **G3** — sector resolution | **any sizing increase** (blocks R2/D1) | *"hard prerequisite of any sizing increase"* | `:1386` |

**SHAPE 2 · A **WITH** B** *(co-requirement — ⛔ not ordering; shipping either alone is the failure)*

| # | must ship TOGETHER | ⚠️ the failure if split | recorded at |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | **G2** ↔ **a tier decision** | *"G2 MUST SHIP WITH A TIER DECISION OR IT SHIPS A DOUBLING"* | `:1385` |
| 7 | **G3 resolution** ↔ **the unit mismatch** | *"fixing G3 ALONE changes nothing"* — the stacked defect | `:1386` |

**SHAPE 3 · A must be CLOSED **BY** B** *(a trap that the later work would spring)*

| # | the trap | must be closed BY | ⚠️ the failure | recorded at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | `position_sizer.py:585` **enforces** `eff_max_position_value_pct` while `:596`/`:609` **report the GLOBAL** | **item 5** — *"BY item 5, not after it"* | identical today (override `null`); **the moment `delivery_max_position_value_pct` is set, the operator-facing CRITICAL states a percentage that was NOT enforced** | `:973` |

⭐ **Shape 3 was not anticipated when this table was commissioned.** It is neither ordering nor
co-requirement: **the later work is what makes the latent defect live**, so the defect must be closed
*as part of* that work rather than before or after it. ⛔ **Recorded as a distinct shape rather than
forced into one of the other two.**

### 🆕 ADDED 06-Aug-2026 EVENING — **SHAPE 1, constraint 9**

| # | must land FIRST | blocks | ⚠️ the concrete failure if violated | recorded at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **9** | 🔴 **VALIDATION OF THE SOURCE a snapshot reads** | **ANY snapshot-at-boot design** *(a delivery baseline, a capital snapshot, a cached inventory)* | **the snapshot preserves stale truth for longer.** ⭐ **Worked example, live tomorrow:** the 08:15 boot replays **₹1,033.50**, of which **₹587.40 is the PHANTOM** ⇒ a delivery baseline snapshotted at boot would hold that error **for the whole session** instead of re-deriving it each cycle | `f6_…design_06aug2026.md` §15 · `eod_email_findings_06aug2026.md` §1 |

> ### ⭐⭐ THE GENERAL FORM, WORTH STATING ONCE AND CITING AFTERWARDS
> **A SNAPSHOT CONVERTS A SELF-CORRECTING ERROR INTO A DURABLE ONE.**
> ⭐ **That is its COST, and it is the price of the determinism it buys** — a per-cycle re-derivation
> is noisy and *self-healing*; a snapshot is stable and *self-perpetuating*. ⛔ **Neither is free, and
> the choice must be made knowing which failure mode is being bought.**
> ⇒ 🏷️ **The generalisation is what belongs here — ⛔ NOT "validate the source after F6."** F6 is
> one instance; **the constraint binds every future snapshot design regardless of F6.**

#### 🆕 07-Aug-2026 00:2x — **CONSTRAINT 9's F6 INSTANCE, RESTATED AS A MECHANISM RATHER THAN A RULE**

> ### **F6 AFFECTS THE CORRECTNESS OF PERSISTENT CAPITAL STATE.**
> ### **Any snapshot-based accounting introduced BEFOREHAND preserves an already-incorrect state ACROSS SESSIONS.**

⭐ **Concretely, and it is measurable this morning:** the **07-Aug 08:15 boot replays ₹1,033.50**, of
which **₹587.40 is the ATULAUTO PHANTOM** (`ee9af41eae554c35`) and ₹446.10 is DIFFNKG's real carry
(`0184b66d4c214416`). ⇒ **A delivery baseline snapshotted at that boot would carry the ₹587.40 error
for the whole session** — and, being persistent, **into the next one.**

⛔⛔ **WHY THE RESTATEMENT IS THE POINT, not a rewording:** *"F6 must land before the snapshot"* is a
**row in a table**; *"a snapshot freezes whatever the capital state is wrong about"* is a
**mechanism**. ⭐ **AN ORDERING RULE WHOSE REASON IS RECORDED SURVIVES A REFACTOR; ONE THAT IS ONLY A
ROW IN A TABLE DOES NOT** — the refactor that renames the item, splits it, or reorders the register
carries the row away and leaves nothing that explains why the order mattered.

🏷️ **Same shape as the table's own general form above** *(a snapshot converts a self-correcting error
into a durable one)* — ⭐ **this is that principle instantiated on the one case that is LIVE**, so the
next reader meets both the rule and a worked example that can be checked against production.

# 🔴 05-AUG-2026 EVENING CONSOLIDATION — **N 231 → 233.** ⛔ TWO NEW ROWS (**A6**, **A7**); EIGHTEEN SUB-ENTRIES.

> **A7 + A7-i/-ii/-iii** at ~21:50 (the registry / pre-flight / Q3 batch). ⭐ **The second pass

## 🆕 A6 — **THE DELIVERY CARRY BREAKS THE DAILY PROCESS LIFECYCLE** *(THE ONE NEW ROW)*

**Root cause:** the system assumes **one process per trading day, flat at EOD.** A carried delivery
position falsifies that premise and three guards that silently depended on it fail together.

**(a) THE EOD SELF-EXIT COUPLING — the day's structural finding.**
**(P)** `17:35:00.002 WARNING main: "eod_self_exit: past 17:35 IST but 1 active position(s) remain
— staying up to manage them; will exit once flat"`; service still `active` at 17:49, start
timestamp unchanged from 08:15:05. **(S)** `_eod_self_exit_due` (`main.py:1073-1113`) is due only at
**zero** active positions; **`emit_census()` runs at `_shutdown()` entry (`main.py:1319`)**.
⇒ 🔴 **THE CENSUS IS ABSENT, NOT LATE.**
⭐ **The interpretability control travels with the zero: 0 `effect_census` against 8,204 `effect`
hits in 93,833 lines** — that control is what makes it evidence rather than a worry.
⭐ **(S) UPGRADE — one production call site, inside `_shutdown()`** *(width: `emit_census` repo-wide,
tests included)* ⇒ **no census can EVER be emitted without a shutdown**, not merely "none today".
⭐⭐ **This is the "declared thing with no effect" family arriving on a GUARD rather than a manager**
— and the coupling was invisible until the day it mattered. **Record: HANDOFF §10.1–10.2.**

**(b) THE RESTART TRAP — a LIVE operational hazard, not a historical note.**
**(S)** at the deployed SHA: `clear_stale_state` refuses a **same-day** kill
(`triggered_date >= today`); `auto_clear_scheduled_kill` refuses on **`open_count > 0`**. Both run
at `main.py:1914`/`:1919`, **before** the scenario check at `:1937`, which returns **4 = HALT** with
`--resume` the only escape — **the command the standing instruction forbids that evening.**
⇒ ⛔ **A restart on a delivery evening leaves the service DOWN AND HALTED with its remedy
prohibited.** 🔴 **True again on ANY evening a delivery position is held.** **Record: HANDOFF §12,
`STOP_PROCEDURE` basis table.**

**Also owned by A6:** no boot ⇒ `clear_stale_state` never runs ⇒ the day's kill survives into the
next session **(I)**; and every alarm emitter stays alive overnight (see the drift loop below).
⛔ **A6 is MEASURED AND REGISTERED ONLY. No fix is designed, proposed or authorised.**

## 📌 THE FIFTEEN SUB-ENTRIES — each named to the row that owns it

| # | finding | class | filed as a sub-entry on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **c** | **the delivery ROUND TRIP closed in the ledger** — `GTT_EXIT`, `exits_verified=1`, `RELEASE_USED` in the same second as `exit_time`, bucket restoration exact; total CNC value reconciles four independent ways | **(P)** | **§A2** — 🏷️ `<ROUND TRIP VERIFIED LIVE 05-Aug; T+1 CARRY UNVERIFIED>`. ⛔ nothing wider |
| **d** | **the CHECK1 gate PASSED, and ran in production for the first time** (`gtt_state` was empty before today) | **(P)** | **§C.5** CHECK1 row. ⭐ **Discharges** Thursday's 08:15 boot meeting a T+1 holding. ⛔ **Does NOT discharge the 4th entry path** `_check_stuck_exiting`, still unguarded, reachability still **(d)** |
| **e** | **FIX-133's floor is LOAD-BEARING for delivery** — `floor(1 × 0.5) = 0`; without it: no order, no GTT, no evidence | 🔴 **(I)** | **§C.1 G8** sizing. ⛔ **NEVER OBSERVED — arithmetic, not measurement.** ⚠️ its removal presents as *"no signals qualified today"*, indistinguishable from a quiet day |
| **f** | **sizing is PINNED BY ARITHMETIC, not configuration** — concentration binds strictly at 1 against 8 and 5; tier multiplier inert at `raw_qty=1` for every `m<1`; `raw_qty` must reach **4** for one extra share | **(S)+(I)** | **§C.1 G8** + **A-DEC-3 item 5**. ⭐ **the intraday twin is already registered** — risk sizer dead by algebra, 298/298 and 415/415. ⇒ **two pipelines with two config surfaces produce TWO INERT SURFACES; the binding constraint is arithmetic and SHARED.** ⛔ item 5's **ORDER** changes, not its existence — a knob inert at ₹10k is not inert at ₹100k, and ₹10k is a testing value. ⛔ **no value proposed** |
| **g** | **the H5 coupling, with the RIGHT code** — `SYMBOL_DIRECTION_DAILY_LIMIT` (`signal_processor.py:693` at `0197923`), and it is **product-BLIND** | **(P)+(S)** | **§B.1 row 7** — ✅ **already filed** (`e3edeb4`). ⛔ *"delivery blocks intraday"* is the wrong description and would send the next reader hunting a product branch that does not exist. **The two codes the run sheet named fired ZERO times** |
| **h** | **the cost model BRANCHES on product** — two rate tables; the day's recorded CNC cost reproduces by hand to the paisa; MIS rates would give ~40% of it | **(S)+(P)** | **§C.1**. 🏷️ **the CNC cost path moves to `VERIFIED LIVE 05-Aug`** ⚠️ hand computation, not an execution |
| **h2** | 🔴 **A CORRECTION I OWE: the "falls back to hardcoded rates" claim is IN NO REGISTER EDITION** | **(P)** | see the correction block below |
| **i** | **the day-P&L gap — (d) CANNOT DETERMINE.** Both hypotheses on the record: **H-A** cost-model asymmetry **REFUTED** (§3.1); **H-B** realised-only ledger vs a marked open position — **PC-side half CONFIRMED** (`fund_manager.py:1809-1847`), broker half open | **(S)** | **§C.1**. ⛔ **neither adopted; nothing reconciled** |
| **j** | **AR9 scored the IN-SESSION regime only** — overnight the band is a flat ₹50, ⭐ **and overnight is the only time delivery can be held** ⇒ the acceptance does not cover the regime that matters | **(P)+(S)** | **§C.2 G18** → pointer to `campaign_practices.md` **AR9** scope correction (`b7d3a18`) |
| **k** | **two `reconcile_once` cycles ABORTED mid-flight** on broker 502s (17:22:37, 17:50:58) | **(P)** | **§C.3**. ⛔ *"transient"* understates it — those cycles' safety checks did **not** complete. ⭐ **whether OTHER cycles completed CANNOT BE DETERMINED** — a healthy cycle logs only when it has actions |
| **l** | 🔴 **`acted` COUNTS ROWS EXAMINED, NOT ACTIONS TAKEN** — `cnc_gtt_monitor.py:145-153` appends a label on **every** path incl. `healthy:`/`noop:`, then counts them all | **(S)** | **§B.1 row 1** (effect-verification / acted-telemetry). 🔴 **changes the reading of ALL historical census evidence.** ⭐ **Four cards asserted otherwise; this correction is the record.** Also carried in `STOP_PROCEDURE` §(g) so a future census reader hits it |
| **m** | **`get_gtts` is UNINSTRUMENTED — 0 call sites logged** ⇒ observed-trigger vs swept-row is **(d)**, and ⛔ **the census was never going to settle it** | **(S)** | **§B.1 row 1**. ⭐ what WOULD settle it: instrument `get_gtts`, or log `bg_status` in `_handle_row`. ⛔ **neither proposed** |
| **n** | **item 4 changed shape** — *"Part A"* does not exist; two real inventories do, and they overlap ⇒ **item 4 begins with a RECONCILIATION, not an annotation** | **(P)** | **§B item 4** — ✅ **already filed** (`0d444f4`), marked **`RECOMMENDED — NOT RULED`** |
| **o** | **122 blank-product rows** — all `FAILED`/`REJECTED`, never filled ⇒ **LATENT, not live** | **(P)** | **§C.3**. ⭐ **the discriminator that would make it LIVE: a blank-product row that ever reaches a FILLED state.** Until then it is a data-completeness gap, not a capital risk |
| **p** | **the 18:45 `system_manager` independently predicted Thursday's auto-clear**, in its own words, and scoped the `resume.sh` prohibition correctly | **(P)** | **§C.5**. ⭐ a second, independent source for the Branch-A prediction ⚠️ **its sentence assumes a boot happens** — which is exactly what A6(a) removes |

### 🔴 h2 — THE CORRECTION, STATED PLAINLY BECAUSE IT IS MINE

**`HANDOFF §3.2` records: *"the older pending register's 'falls back to hardcoded rates' claim is
REFUTED."*** ⛔ **THAT ATTRIBUTION IS WRONG. No register edition ever made that claim.**
**Width, stated:** `grep -iE "fallback|hardcod|hard-cod"` across **all three editions**
(`01-Aug` · `30-Jul` · `28-Jul`) → **13 hits, not one about cost rates** — NULL-product FLATTEN,
the manual-GTT formula, MIS→CNC, the `?token=` fallback, BK-8 config drift, paper positions.
⭐ **The underlying FACT stands and is unaffected** — `config_loader.py:1852` says outright that no
hardcoded fallback exists, and a test enforces it (`test_fix131_broker_costs.py`). **What was wrong
was the attribution, not the finding.**
⛔ **So there is nothing in the register to correct — and saying "corrected 1 record" would have
been the same defect in the other direction.** ⭐ **Third instance today of attributing a claim to a
record without reading the record** *(the M8 shape — see `campaign_practices.md` M8 and the M1
sub-taxonomy)*.

### 📎 PRACTICES WRITTEN TODAY — ⛔ POINTERS ONLY, TEXT LIVES IN `docs/campaign_practices.md`
**M7** (a digest without its method) · **M8** (read the record before measuring) · **M9** (evidence

**(1) 🏁 THE STOP EXECUTED — 22:46:36, CLEAN.** `inactive · dead · Result=success · ExecMainStatus=0`;
service **did not return after 142 s**; **census recovered — 55 lines, `mismatches=0`.** Authorised by
**Rama in his own words**; ⚠️ **the stated reason was AUTHORED BY ChatGPT and ADOPTED by him — ⛔ not
written by him.**
⭐⭐ **THE FACT WITH NO PRIOR INSTANCE: `_shutdown()` ran to completion with a real CNC delivery
position held — squared off nothing, cancelled nothing, released no capital, closed no position.**
⭐ **The safety argument was read from source all evening; at 22:46:36 it held in production.**

**(2) 🏷️ A6's STATUS MOVES — AND IT MOVES TO *WORKED AROUND*, ⛔ NOT *FIXED*.**
The EOD self-exit coupling was **observed** (17:35 deferral, service still `active` at 17:49) and then
**circumvented by a manual clean stop**. ⛔ **No code changed. The coupling is exactly as it was.**
🔴 **IT WILL RECUR ON THE NEXT EVENING A DELIVERY POSITION IS HELD** — and the workaround is a human
decision each time, not a mechanism. ⭐ **Recording a workaround as a workaround is the point: the
census is only recoverable while someone remembers to stop the service.**

**(3) ✅ THE CENSUS EXPECTATION — NOT REFUTED, AND IT GOES NO FURTHER.**
`cnc_gtt_placer acted 2` · `cnc_gtt_monitor acted 24` · `MISMATCH: NONE — every zero is an expected
zero`. ⛔⛔ **`acted` counts rows EXAMINED, not actions TAKEN** (`orders/cnc_gtt_monitor.py:145-153`
appends on `healthy:`/`needs_review:`/`noop:` alike) ⇒ ⭐ **ARTIFACT RECOVERED, QUESTION NOT ANSWERED**;
observed-vs-swept stays **(d)** until `get_gtts` is instrumented (**0** call sites logged).
✅ **The `entries=70` / `62 registered` / 52 printed arithmetic reconciles EXACTLY** — 70 − 18 `infra`
= 52, 70 − 8 `expected-absent` = 62. **Design, not defect** ⚠️ *(though the `BEGIN` line invites a miscount)*.

**(4) ✅ THE 22:19 DRIFT ALERT — DECOMPOSED AND VERIFIED TERM BY TERM.**
**632.01 = 587.40** *(the CNC purchase, deducted BROKER-SIDE ONLY)* **+ 44.61** *(realised P&L, booked
locally, unsettled)*. **(S)** `order_reconciler.py:3590-3592`: `expected = snapshot.total` ·
`actual = margins.net`. **Three terms measured via INDEPENDENT paths** — opening from `fm_ledger` INIT,
realised by **two** routes (7 `RELEASE_USED` rows **and** the same 7 trades' `net_pnl`), purchase from
`qty_filled × entry_actual_price`.
⛔⛔ **EXPLICITLY *NOT* THE VACUOUS IDENTITY `V5` DELETED THE SAME DAY** — neither operand came from
subtracting the alert. ⭐ **It could have gone red.**
⭐ **CREDIT: the MECHANISM is RAMA'S** — *"the broker deducts the CNC purchase from free cash; the
system does not; in MIS it never shows because 15:30 squares off and the two reconverge."* **The cost
refinement (the blocked figure is the RAW scrip value) is MINE.**
⭐⭐ **AND HIS SETTLEMENT FACTS, RECORDED AS THE GENERAL RULE: costs AND profits both settle on the
NEXT TRADING DAY — which is precisely why MIS never shows this and delivery does.** *(It is also what
makes Thursday's opening balance a real test rather than a curiosity.)*

**(5) 🔴 AR9 — VERIFICATION UPGRADE ONLY.** The band was the **flat ₹50 overnight** figure
(`tolerance=50.00 base=50.00`), **delta = 12.64×**; **(S)** `:3626-3631` widens by percentage **during
market hours only**. ⛔ **Acceptance UNCHANGED. No tolerance proposed. Still one session of evidence.**

**(6) ✅ THE 08:15 TOKEN REFRESH IS PC-INDEPENDENT.** **(S)**, width stated: VM-resident cron line ·
*"fully headless via TOTP"* · a grep across the script **and both reused modules** for tailscale /
private-IPs / mounts / scp / rsync / listen / socket / localhost / Windows paths returns **only the
Zerodha URLs**, against a **control** proving the pattern matches elsewhere. **(P)** no network mounts;
credentials present under the names `accounts.csv` declares.
⚠️ **MECHANISM VERIFIED, OBSERVATION NOT — Thursday is the FIRST run with the PC off** (07:55–08:25).
⛔ **Do not let that read as unverified, and do not let it read as observed.**

**(7) 📜 G1 #7 — ⭐ THE AUTO-FILL STOPPED BEING TEXT AND BECAME THE ACT.** The ladder is complete:
**suggest work → grant permission → PERFORM THE ACT.** ⛔⛔ **The command was CORRECT and the action
was AUTHORISED — which is exactly why it counts:** plausibility is the attack surface, and a rule that
needs the suggestion to be wrong fails on the one that is right.
⭐ **The general rule it earned: A COMMAND'S OWN OUTPUT IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ITS EFFECT** — five bogus
units failed loudly while the one that mattered stopped **silently**. *(Which is why step (c) is a
SEPARATE verification.)*

**(8) ⚠️ THE 02-Aug `Bash(ssh *)` MEMORY ENTRY: `REQUIRES RE-MEASUREMENT`.** Read-only `ssh` ran
unprompted all night; the **one** `sudo` was **DENIED twice**. Two candidate explanations recorded,
**neither tested**. ⛔ **The boundary was NOT probed and stays unprobed** — establishing which holds by
running candidate `sudo` commands would be using a live money system as a test rig.
⭐ **An inaccurate RISK entry fails in the WORSE direction: it makes you defend a hazard that has moved.**

**(9) 📜 M1 GAINS GROUP 3 — THE SELECTION BOUNDARY.** *(⛔ instances, not a new rule.)*
**Filter WIDER than the subject** — realised P&L summed to `0.0` because a `RESET_PNL −44.61` cancels
the seven **by design**; ⭐ **that one would have refuted a CORRECT finding.** **Filter NARROWER** —
`ZERODHA_API_KEY` read as MISSING because I checked the **fallback** name, not the **declared** one.
⭐⭐ **Group 3 is the nastiest of the three: pattern, corpus AND width are each defensible, so nothing
about the query looks wrong.** ⇒ **the width must now name the PREDICATE too.**
**Three false zeros last night, all caught by controls.** *(The third — a self-truncated grep window —

| # | item | state | what unblocks it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **T+1 CARRY** — does CHECK1's delivery skip hold when the position has left `positions()` for `holdings()`? | 🔴 **the ONLY one with a date** | **Resolves THU 06-Aug**, `THURSDAY_CONTINGENCY` Branch-A-continued **step 3**; falsifiable expectation + baseline written **before** the fact |
| **2** | **`_check_stuck_exiting`** — the **fourth** CHECK1 entry path, still **UNGUARDED** by the `trade_id` delivery skip | reachability **(d)** — undetermined | Not a fix; needs its own careful loop. ⛔ Do not widen from the guarded three |
| **3** | **`get_gtts` UNINSTRUMENTED** — **0** call sites logged | ⇒ observed-vs-swept is **permanently (d)** until instrumented | ⛔ **NOT proposed.** It is why the census's `acted` cannot answer the GTT question |
| **4** | **AR9's OVERNIGHT SCOPE GAP** — the drift acceptance scored the **in-session** band only | ⭐ **the overnight band is the one delivery actually lives in** (₹50 flat vs 10%) | One session is not enough to move a money-path governor; recurrence across sessions is |
| **5** | **ITEM 4 — inventory reconciliation** (two real control inventories exist and overlap) | ⛔ **BLOCKED on Rama's AUTHORITY ruling** | Which inventory survives. ⛔ Annotating either alone creates a **third** authority |
| **6** | **ITEM 5 — the delivery config surface** | gated on **#5**, ⭐ **and RE-ORDERED BY MEASUREMENT** | **concentration + tier multiplier FIRST; risk and position value AFTER** — at ₹10,000 the quantity is pinned by arithmetic, so the other two cannot bind |
| **7** | **THE REGISTRY-TRACKED-IN-GIT GOVERNANCE QUESTION** *(new tonight — A7(e))* | 🔴 **Rama's ruling** | Should a file production rewrites daily be version-controlled? ⛔ Not "which version wins" — neither does |
| **8** | **THE 122 BLANK-PRODUCT ROWS** | **LATENT** | Discriminator: **a blank-product row ever reaching a FILLED state.** Until then, document + pin |

## 🆕 A7 — **`strategy_direction_registry.yaml`: A TRACKED CONFIG FILE THAT PRODUCTION WRITES DAILY** *(N 232 → 233 — ONE new row; the three items below it are sub-entries, not rows)*

**The deployed-tree divergence flagged as a possible pre-push blocker is REAL, EXPLAINED, and its
mechanism is a bigger finding than the divergence.** ⛔ **It is NOT a stale checkout.**

**(a) IT IS WRITTEN AT RUNTIME — ANSWERED YES.**
**(S)** `save_registry` (`core/strategy_direction.py:81-88`, atomic tmp+rename) — **sole non-test
caller** `scripts/strategy_registry_officer.py:254`, driven by the cron job
`strategy_registry_officer` **16:22 Mon-Fri** (`config/cron_registry.yaml`, `market_day_only: true`).
**Width, stated:** `git grep "save_registry|DEFAULT_REGISTRY_PATH|load_registry"` repo-wide → 3
production sites, exactly **one** writes; plus `git grep "yaml\.(safe_)?dump" -- '*.py'` → no other
writer touches this path.
**(P) THE MTIME SETTLES IT: `2026-08-05 16:22:01` IST — today, to the second of the cron slot.**
⇒ ⛔ **"the deploy did not overwrite it" is REFUTED; something on the VM writes it, on schedule.**

**(b) TRACKED, NOT IGNORED — ⇒ the defect is the COMBINATION, and a push does revert it.**
**(P)** `git ls-files` → `config/strategy_direction_registry.yaml` is **tracked**;
`git check-ignore` → **rc=1, not ignored**; `.gitattributes` has no rule for it.
**(P)** the live hook (`~/trading-system.git/hooks/post-receive`) runs
`git --work-tree=… --git-dir=… checkout -f main` ⇒ **the next push DOES overwrite the live copy.**
⭐ **And this was FORESEEN AND DOCUMENTED ON THE DAY IT SHIPPED** —
`docs/audit/strategy_direction_registry_done_17jul2026.md:125-127` calls it the *"Deploy-reset
note … the officer re-derives status/health from the DB on its next run (self-healing) — a benign,
documented behaviour."* ⛔ **So this is not an unknown; it is a known design accepted in 17-Jul.**

**(c) WHAT THE TWO VERSIONS DISAGREE ABOUT — ⛔ reported, NOT judged. Three classes, nothing else:**
| class | direction | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| **24-line comment banner** | in **git**, absent on the **VM** | the purpose/mandate/3-concept header. `yaml.safe_dump` round-trips **data only** ⇒ the first officer write destroyed it, permanently, by construction |
| **`registration_status: PENDING → CONFIRMED`** | on the **VM**, not in git | **13 of 16** strategies. This is the officer's actual work product, derived from FILLED trades. The 3 still PENDING never traded |
| **`"2026-07-17"` → `'2026-07-17'`** | VM | pure `safe_dump` quote normalisation, all 16 — semantically identical |
⭐ **`direction` is IDENTICAL on all 16 and `health: OK` everywhere — ZERO `DIRECTION_CONFLICT`.**
⇒ **the divergence is 100% registration-status + formatting; the authoritative field never moved.**
**(P)** numbers reproduce exactly: **29 insertions / 54 deletions**; and **the committed file is
byte-identical at `0197923` and at HEAD** (md5 `f87787ff…` both) ⇒ **none of the unpushed commits
touch this file.**

**(d) 🔴 THE PUSH QUESTION — ANSWERED, and it is NOT the blocker it looked like.**
**(S) Nothing reads this file except its own writer.** Width: `load_registry` production callers →
**1** (`strategy_registry_officer.py:224`); `registered_direction` → **ZERO callers anywhere**,
tests included; `registration_status` / `DIRECTION_CONFLICT` appear in **no** trading-path module.
`build_direction_map` has one live consumer (`orders/eod_squareoff.py:695`) and it reads
`config/strategies/*.yaml`, **never this registry**.
⇒ ✅ **A push is SAFE with respect to this file's runtime effect.** What it destroys is derived
state that self-heals silently at the next officer run (`_notify` early-returns unless a strategy is
**new** or **conflicted** — `strategy_registry_officer.py:173`; a re-confirmation is silent).
⚠️ **With one stated consequence: the officer is `market_day_only` at 16:22, so a push tonight
leaves the live file all-PENDING until THU 16:22.** Inert, because nothing reads it — but say it.

**(e) ⭐⭐ THE FINDING THAT IS LARGER THAN THE DIVERGENCE — 🔴 RAMA'S RULING, AND IT IS NOT
"WHICH VERSION SURVIVES".** Neither survives: **the file oscillates by design** — deploy restores
the banner and all-PENDING, the next officer run destroys the banner and restores CONFIRMED. The
real question is the one the 17-Jul note settled without stating: **should a file that production
rewrites daily be version-controlled at all?** ⭐ **Same shape as the `mempalace.yaml` /
ledger-not-in-git facet (debt-ledger #12) — a document whose authority and whose writer disagree.**
⛔ **NOT decided here. NOT fixed. NO change proposed to the file, the officer, or `.gitignore`.**

**(f) §1.5 ADJACENCY — CHECKED, AND IT IS EMPTY. ⛔ THREAD NOT OPENED.**
Today's live H5 gate `SYMBOL_DIRECTION_DAILY_LIMIT` lives in `signals/signal_processor.py`, which
has **zero** occurrences of `strategy_direction`, `load_registry`, `registration_status`, or
`strategy_direction_registry` *(width: those 4 patterns across both files that mention the H5 code)*.
⇒ **The adjacency is NAME-ONLY ("direction" in both), not a code coupling.** Recorded, not followed.

## 🆕 A7-i — **THE 08:30 AUTOFIX: THE PREMISE WAS WRONG, AND THE TRUE HAZARD IS ITS MIRROR IMAGE** *(sub-entry)*

⛔ **"Pre-flight will retry the failed boot up to three times" is REFUTED.** It will attempt **zero**.
**(S)** `scripts/preflight/checks/__init__.py:48` — `ServiceActiveCheck("trading-system.service",
auto_fixable=False)`, commented *"ALERT-ONLY (token-watcher owns lifecycle; never auto-start)"*;
`checks/services.py:5-8` states the same design; `SUPPORT_SERVICES` (`services.py:85-92`) is **six
daemons** and `trading-system` is not among them. The `systemctl_start_service` auto-fix is genuinely
armed and whitelisted (`autofix.py:35`) — **it just does not cover the app.**
**(P)** `RestartPreventExitStatus=3 4` confirmed on the **live** unit ⇒ systemd will not loop either.
⭐⭐ **THE REAL HAZARD, AND IT LANDS ON BRANCH B:** Phase B's probe is `systemctl is-active`
(`services.py:31-39`), which **cannot separate a fresh boot from Wednesday's surviving process** ⇒
under the predicted no-boot, **pre-flight reports `svc_trading_system` PASS at 09:14 on exactly the
failure mode being predicted.** ⇒ **the same unchecked-precondition defect as A7-ii, arriving from a
more authoritative-looking direction.** **Folded into `THURSDAY_CONTINGENCY_06-Aug-2026.md`.**
⚠️ **Also found, LATENT, ⛔ not fixed:** `autofix.py` whitelists **8** fix actions but only **5** are
declared by any check — **`kill_switch_prior_day_clear`, `wal_checkpoint_passive`,
`cancel_stale_orphan_order` have ZERO implementers** *(width: `git grep` each across all tracked
files)*. ⇒ the whitelist **pre-authorises a kill-switch mutation that nothing performs.** Inert
today; same family as the allowlist pre-authorisation item.

## 🆕 A7-ii — **THE 18:45 `system_manager` "HEADLESS GUARANTEE": AN INSTANCE OF §B#9 / `F4`, NOT A NEW ROW** *(sub-entry)*

**(P)** it printed, unprompted: *"prior-day at the next open, so the 2026-08-06 08:15 boot
auto-clears it (HEADLESS GUARANTEE). No action needed; ⛔ do NOT run deploy/resume.sh for this."*
⭐ **As corroboration it is excellent** — a (P) artifact agreeing with the (S) reading, from a process
that did not know it was being watched.
🔴 **AND IT IS THE FAMILY'S SHAPE EXACTLY: THE PREDICATE IT TESTS IS NOT THE PREDICATE IT NEEDS.**
**(S)** `scripts/system_manager.py:724` guards the sentence on **`trig_date < nxt`** — a pure **DATE**
comparison. **THE MISSING PREDICATE IS THE EXISTENCE OF THE BOOT ITSELF:** the message names *"the
2026-08-06 08:15 boot"* as a fact, and **nothing in the guard establishes that a boot will occur.**
On the one night it might not, it still says *"No action needed"* — ⛔ **an operator who read only
that would have gone to bed.**
⭐⭐ **WHAT MAKES THIS THE SHARPEST INSTANCE YET: THE CODE IS MORE CAREFUL THAN AVERAGE, NOT LESS.**
Its own comment (`:703-706`) argues explicitly for the date axis over the reason axis, and its two
`else` branches defend against an **unreadable** `triggered_at` (*"if we cannot establish the date we
must NOT claim it is safe"*) and a **future-dated** row. ⇒ **all three branches reason carefully
about one axis and all three assume a boot happens.** **The defensive care was spent entirely on the
axis that was considered.**
⛔ **NO FIX PROPOSED — deliberately.** **(M5)** the honest form would have to carry the precondition
**in the same sentence as the conclusion** rather than leave it to the reader.
📌 **Filed as an instance of §B#9 (IA-P9-01/-02, alert fatigue / false-safety claims) and of §C.6
`F4`. ⛔ Not a new rule; not a new row.**

## 🆕 A7-iii — **ChatGPT's Q3, ANSWERED: YES for a KILL, NO for the HALT SCENARIO** *(sub-entry)*

**Q3:** *"Could `clear_stale_state` succeed while another initialisation stage recreates HALT before
trading starts?"* **Width:** `git grep` for every `.soft_kill(`/`.hard_kill(`/`.record_api_failure(`
call in production `.py` (**40 sites**), each mapped to its enclosing `def` by AST, then filtered to
those invoked between `main.py:1914` and the first trading action. **All cites at `0197923`.**
- ✅ **The six `main.py` kill sites are all inside deferred CALLBACKS** (`_on_critical_skew`,
  `_on_critical_failure`, `_on_force_close`, `_on_api_failure`, `_on_daily_loss_breach`, `_on_orphan`)
  — registered at boot, fired only by their runtime conditions.
- 🔴 **TWO real boot-path stages CAN set a kill, both AFTER the clear and BEFORE trading:**
  **(1)** `main.py:2442` `rehydrate_from_open_trades()` → `capital/fund_manager.py:1761` invariant →
  `:1769` → `:2351` **`hard_kill`** + raises ⇒ **main returns 3** — **single sample**;
  **(2)** `main.py:3403` `reconcile_once()` → `orders/order_reconciler.py:976`
  `_check9_missing_exits` → `:2830` **`soft_kill("MISSING_EXITS…")`** — **single sample**.
  Both precede `main.py:3497` `signal_processor.start()`, guarded by the boot-order assert `:3491`.
- ✅ **The third is NOT reachable on the boot cycle:** `_finalise_auth_counter` (`:720`) needs **3
  consecutive** cycles; the counter starts at 0.
⭐ **THE SOURCE SAYS SO AT THE CALL SITE** (`main.py:1911-1913`): *"if the trigger was legitimate,
startup reconciliation will re-trigger it within seconds"* — **now traced to a real mechanism rather
than taken on the comment's word.**
✅ **BUT THE HALT *SCENARIO* CANNOT BE RE-CREATED:** it is decided **once** at `main.py:1922` and
consumed at `:1938-1944`; `scenario` is never recomputed ⇒ a post-gate kill **does not** produce
exit 4. ⭐ **This weakens Branch A rather than strengthening it** — "active with a Thursday
timestamp" does **not** establish the kill is clear — and Branch A now carries a confirming command.
**§4.2 — the boot capital seed: (S) CONFIRMED it cannot itself trigger anything.**
`fund_manager.initialize()` (`capital/fund_manager.py:417-457`) is a pure **INIT** —
`balance_before=0.0`, set buckets, **no comparison, no threshold, no drift publish, no kill**;
`check_paper_capital_consistency` is a **no-op in live mode** (`utils/startup_checks.py:982`).
⚠️ **But the stage immediately after it is stage (1) above, and THURSDAY IS ITS FIRST RUN WALKING AN
OPEN CNC DELIVERY TRADE.** **(I)** the guard needs a **negative** bucket (`fund_manager.py:2297`) and
the positional bucket is a fixed **30%** (`conditional_allocation_enabled: false`, verified on the
VM) ⇒ ~₹2,789 of a ~₹9,296 seed vs a ~₹587 block ≈ **4.7× headroom** ⇒ **not expected to fire.**
⛔⛔ **THAT IS AN ESTIMATE FROM WEDNESDAY'S FIGURES, NOT A MEASUREMENT OF THURSDAY — recorded as
`CANNOT DETERMINE`, ⛔ NOT as a NO.** ⭐ **And it exposed a gap: an exit-3 boot failure falls into
Branch D, which said "nobody predicted this". It is now named there.**

> because of **who made it and how it arrived**, not because of what it says.

| # | THE RULING |
|---|---|
| **R1** | ⭐ **THE FILTER-SLIP GATE IS 3-PART.** If the buy-day filter is not live, **postpone the ENTIRE flip** until the filter is available — **not** just the carry pilot. ⇒ **A0 is CLOSED** (see below) |
| **R2** | ⭐⭐ **DEPLOY SLOT = OPTION Y.** **Mon 3-Aug eve:** push **code + docs, WITHOUT the flip flags.** · **Tue 4-Aug:** one additional **clean observation / shakedown day** — first real EOD census that evening, filter **dormant-armed**. · **Tue 4-Aug eve:** push **the flip flags alone.** ⇒ ⭐ **WED 5-AUG IS THE FLIP DAY — no longer Tue 4-Aug** |
| **R3** | **CONFIRMED — #2b and #2c-R ride the same push.** They already sit in the same linear history and **cannot be excluded** (`campaign_practices.md` **§D1** — there is no partial deploy) |
| **R4** | **CONFIRMED YES — the `cnc_gtt_placer` + `cnc_gtt_monitor` registry edits** (expected-dormant → expected-event-driven) ride the **SAME push as the flip flags**, i.e. **Tue 4-Aug evening** under Option Y. ⛔ Otherwise the census **mismatches by design** on the day delivery goes live |
| **R5(a)** | ✅ **DISCHARGED 03-Aug `38f8ab9` `<BUILT — NOT DEPLOYED>`** (implemented as a loud BLOCK — exit 2, both sanctioned paths named — because a silent deletion would have preserved the print-success-change-nothing trap; `--cleanup-*` untouched, allowlist NOT narrowed, R12 still owed). **APPROVED — OPTION A: remove `--reset` from `scripts/check_vm_state.py` entirely.** Basis: no automation caller · no runtime coupling · **no second VM copy** (Rama's own VM check) · `clear_kill_switch.py` already serves the use case correctly in **both** modes |
| **R5(b)** | ⛔ **HOLD — #8b does NOT ride Monday's push.** Implement **only AFTER Monday's critical path has finished** |

## ⭐⭐ A-DEC-2 — **RULINGS D1–D7 — RATIFIED 03-Aug-2026 23:57 IST.** *(record written 04-Aug 00:0x; stamped to the working night per the card — the clock read is stated so the stamp is a convention, not a claim)*

> ### 📜 PROVENANCE — ⚠️ **THIS ROUND ARRIVES UNDER AN AMENDED §G2, AND THAT IS ITSELF A RULING**
> **Rama's standing ruling, 03-Aug-2026: *"ChatGPT's replies count as my replies, no
> deviations."*** ⇒ these seven are **decisions, not advice**, and `campaign_practices.md`
> **§G2 has been amended** to say so (old text struck-through-but-legible per §G4).
> ⛔ **THE BOUNDARY, RECORDED WITH THE DELEGATION BECAUSE THE CHAIN NOW MATTERS:** text can

> reasoning, not to the round trip.

| # | THE RULING |
|---|---|
| **D1** | **#2d = OPTION A.** Sites **A** and **C** adopt the proven `cancel_order(variety="co")` path; ⛔ **Site B REFUSES AND ESCALATES** — matching #2c-R's shape. ⭐ **This is the answer Step 1 pointed at:** Site B iterates BROKER positions that by design have **no local trade row** (`kill_switch.py:1543-1546`), so it cannot reach a parent order id — *"mirror `eod_squareoff` at all three sites"* was **not achievable as stated.** ⭐ **Refusing where you *can* act is only right when you can't.** ⛔ Still gated on its own careful loop; LATENT (CO doubly dormant) ⇒ a hard gate on **enabling CO**, not on the flip |
| **D2** | **#3a = OPTION A — persist BROKER TRUTH ONLY.** If the broker reports nothing, the column **stays empty and says so**. ⛔ **NEVER write the inferred final** (`final_qty`/`final_price`, which substitute the PLANNED qty and the EXPECTED price): **a plausible fabrication in an audit column is indistinguishable from a real fill afterwards** — ⭐ **the identical property that made the backfill wrong (R-4)**, now applied at the writer instead of at the backfill. ⇒ the §1.5(i) decision is CLOSED; §1.5(ii) the untrack/idempotency review and §1.5(iii) the missing COMPLETE-path test remain part of the build |
| **D3** | **`STRATEGY PAUSED` = OPTION A — the BEHAVIOUR is wrong.** Persist the pause across restart, and **split *"create a pause"* from *"honour an existing pause"*** (the one-guard-doing-two-jobs root, record §2.7.3). ⭐ **A conditional reword may ship as a TEMPORARY clarification — ⛔ NEVER as the solution.** ⛔ And ⛔ **not the flat reword**: *"clears on restart"* is FALSE on the pre-cutoff branch (§2.7.2), so even the interim must carry the conditional |
| **D4** | **R12 — scope the allowlist to READ-ONLY DIAGNOSTICS.** ⛔ **No pre-authorised state-changing operations against the live DB.** ⚠️ **MEASUREMENT REQUIRED FIRST — see below; do NOT narrow on assumption.** ⭐⭐ **04-Aug: THE MEASUREMENT RAN AND THE MECHANISM DID NOT SURVIVE IT — ⛔ but THE INTENT IS UNTOUCHED AND CORRECT (§G5).** *"Scope the allowlist"* narrows **1 of 3** independent surfaces; `Bash(ssh *)` alone re-permits `--cleanup-pending` ⇒ narrowing as ruled yields a **"read-only scope" that still permits everything.** 🔴 **RETURNED FOR A RULING ON THE MECHANISM ONLY.** **Recommendation — and it INVERTS D4's implied order: (1) `permissions.deny` FIRST**, expressed to hold **regardless of channel** (`--cleanup-*` · `--reset` · `sed -i` on the production `.env` · webhook POST · live-service restart) — ⭐ **an ALLOWLIST STRUCTURALLY CANNOT express *"never `--cleanup-*`"* while any broad channel exists, and every future wildcard silently re-opens it; a DENY rule can.** Precedent in-system: `~/tools/claude/.claude/settings.json`, **14 deny rules.** **(2) THEN** narrow the allow entries (the 21 PowerShell + the Bash channel). **(3) stale cleanup LAST, or not at all** — ⛔ cosmetic while (1) is undone. 📄 `docs/audit/r12_allowlist_enumeration_04aug2026.md` |
| **D5** | **R13 — RETIRE `mempalace.yaml`.** ⇒ stop naming it in card memory-update directives once the retirement lands. ⚠️ **Scope measured — see below; it is not one file.** ✅ **EXECUTED 04-Aug ~02:0x `<BUILT>`** — but ⛔ **only after a re-measurement halted it once: the file held `F1..F9` with NO tracked copy, so retiring it as scoped would have been a DELETION.** ⭐ Ruled that **moving unique content out is not a G3 "fix" but the PRECONDITION of the authorised retirement** ⇒ migrated verbatim (md5-proven) to `ops_dashboard/docs/F_BACKLOG.md`, **then** retired: 2 pointers repointed (incl. a 5th site the name-keyed sweep could not see), `.gitignore` **ignore KEPT + annotated**, ⛔ `SYSTEM_MAP.md` untouched (dated history). 🔴 **Tail open, non-blocking: the `.exe` stays installed; external card templates unswept.** ⭐ Earned **§M5** |
| **D6** | **R14 — PIN AND CAP pytest/tooling versions** so gate results are reproducible. ⭐ Earned twice: `requirements-dev.txt` says `pytest>=9.0.3` with **no ceiling**, so a force-reinstall silently moved the gate to 9.1.1 mid-campaign. ✅ **LANDED 04-Aug ~01:2x `<BUILT>`** — `pytest==9.0.3` + `pytest-cov==7.1.0`, exact pins matching the versions verified installed, so the pin cannot itself move the gate; the interpreter is now named in **§V2**. ✅ Gate scope collects **5,546** = the recorded **5,539 + exactly the 7 tests `4149263` added** ⇒ the repaired venv and the pin are both sound. ⚠️ `cryptography` also drifted 46.0.7→50.0.0 in the same repair, but it lives in **`requirements.txt` (PRODUCTION)** — ⛔ **deliberately NOT touched here** (§G3); it is a separate call with a VM blast radius. ⚠️ **§V2 still lacks the `venv/` half of the base-worktree recipe** — known, recorded, **not folded in silently** |
| **D7** | **IA-XDOCS-03 (map inversion) — PARK, with an EXPLICIT TRIGGER.** ⛔ Parked ≠ closed; it stays counted. The trigger must be written down, or "parked" decays into "forgotten" |

### ⚠️ D4 · R12 — **MEASUREMENT OWED BEFORE ANY NARROWING** *(not done here)*
Enumerate the **actual reachable command paths** in `.claude/settings.local.json`: which
entries are live, which name paths that **no longer exist**, and what each one actually
permits. ⭐ **Narrowing on assumption is exactly how a "read-only scope" quietly keeps a
destructive hole** — and this surface already has 21 `check_vm_state` entries of which
~~**eleven point at `~/check_vm_state.py`, a path Rama's own VM check proved absent.**~~
⛔ **CORRECTED 04-Aug-2026 per §G4 — struck, not replaced, because the original figure is
what the re-measurement is evidence against.** The eleven are real, **but the count was wrong
and wrong LOW: 66 entries name a VM identity that is not live** (`80.225.198.195` 51 ·
`161.118.188.171` 12 — ⛔ **also stale despite looking current**, the tracked record runs
`161.118.187.249` **19-to-1** and the ssh alias agrees · `opc@` 3), and the stale **path**
generation `~/trading-system/` is **69 — six times the flagged eleven.**
⭐ **This mattered more than the arithmetic:** a measurement scoped to *"how many name the
absent script"* answers a narrower question than *"how many are stale"* — **§M5 again, on the
register's own figure.**
⛔ The read-only diagnostics MUST survive; the two `--cleanup-*` flags MUST NOT be
pre-authorised. **Removing `--reset` from the script did not narrow the allowlist** — they
are independent surfaces, which is why R12 is still owed after `38f8ab9`.

##### ✅ R12 — **MEASURED 04-Aug ~02:3x. ⛔ NOTHING NARROWED.** 📄 `docs/audit/r12_allowlist_enumeration_04aug2026.md`
⭐⭐ **D4's REMEDY AS WRITTEN NARROWS ONE OF TWO INDEPENDENT CHANNELS, AND WOULD HAVE LEFT
EVERY DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION REACHABLE.** All **21** `check_vm_state` entries are on the
**PowerShell** tool, and there is **no `PowerShell(ssh *)`** — so removal genuinely bites there
(**21/21 unsubsumed**). ⛔ **But `Bash(ssh *)` and `Bash(ssh trading-vm *)` exist**, and
`Bash(ssh *)` alone pre-authorises
`ssh trading-vm "python3 scripts/check_vm_state.py --cleanup-pending"` — **the exact command D4
exists to stop.** ⇒ there are **THREE** independent surfaces, not two: the **script**
(narrowed by `38f8ab9`) · the **PowerShell** channel · the **Bash** channel, **which D4 does
not name.**
⛔⛔ **AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SURFACE IS FAR WIDER THAN `check_vm_state`'s three flags.** Measured
across 533 entries: **26** restart the live service · ⭐ **15 POST a hand-written payload to
the LIVE webhook** — *a fabricated signal injected into the running system, on the SIGNAL PATH,
never registered anywhere* · **6** push/deploy (incl. `deploy_audit_fixes.ps1 -Force`) · **5**
mutate the production venv · **3** `git pull` the deployed code · **2** `sed -i` the production
`.env` — ⚠️ **one of which comments out `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, disabling an auth control.**
⚠️ **THE STALE COUNT WAS WRONG, AND LOW: 66 entries name a VM address that is not live, not
11.** Four identities coexist — `trading-vm` alias **149** (✅ live, `~/.ssh/config` →
`161.118.187.249`) · `ubuntu@80.225.198.195` **51** · `ubuntu@161.118.188.171` **12**
(⛔ **also stale** — the tracked record carries `161.118.187.249` ×19 vs this ×1) ·
`opc@…` **3**. Path generations: `~/trading-system/` **69** (⛔ stale, **6× the flagged
eleven**) · `~/check_vm_state.py` **11** · `~/systems/trading-system/` **7** (current).
⛔ **Staleness is not safety** — inert only until a host or path returns, and the wildcard
channel does not depend on any path being correct.
⚠️ **SEVERITY BOUNDED, per the scope correction:** VM assistant work is **agy (Google/Gemini)**;
**Claude has no production role there** ⇒ this governs an **interactive dev-time agent in a
session Rama is driving**, ⛔ not autonomous production access. ⭐ It does not dissolve the
finding — pre-authorisation's whole effect is **removing the prompt**.
🔴 **OPEN, none decided:** the **Bash channel** · whether the 15 webhook-POST entries are
acceptable · whether deleting the 66 stale entries is anything but cosmetic while the channel
stands · ⭐ **whether `permissions.deny` should carry the guarantee instead** — an allowlist
cannot express *"never `--cleanup-*`"* while a broad channel exists, and the precedent is
already in this system (`~/tools/claude/.claude/settings.json`, **14 deny rules**).

### ✅ D5 · R13 — **RETIREMENT SCOPE MEASURED 04-Aug 00:0x (M1 sweep, repo-wide)**
**28 files · 58 mentions** — ⭐ **and the actionable set is far smaller than the sweep**, which
is the finding:
- ⛔ **~24 are HISTORICAL/ARCHIVE** (`docs/web_claude/**` ×15, `docs/archive/**`,
  `docs/audit/**` dated records, `reports/crash_test/**`). **These must NOT be edited** —
  they are the record of what was true then; rewriting them is the history-rewrite §G4
  exists to prevent. **Retirement means they become correct-as-history, not wrong.**
- ✅ **LIVE sites needing the edit: `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md` · `docs/MASTER_PENDING_01-Aug-2026.md`
  · `ops_dashboard/docs/SOAK_EVIDENCE_TEMPLATE.md` · `.gitignore`.**
- ⚠️ **NEW, and it changes the shape: `venv/Scripts/mempalace.exe` exists — `mempalace` is an
  INSTALLED CLI PACKAGE, not merely a stale yaml.** Retiring the *file* leaves the *tool*
  installed. Whether the package is also uninstalled is a separate call.
- ⛔ The **card templates** that name it are **EXTERNAL** (cards stay outside the repo, by
  standing rule) ⇒ that half cannot be swept from here and must be done at the card source.

#### ⛔⛔ D5 · R13 — **RE-MEASURED 04-Aug ~01:2x AT EXECUTION TIME. THE EDIT IS HALTED; THE SCOPE ABOVE DOES NOT SURVIVE IT.**
The scope block above is **kept verbatim per §G4** — it is superseded on three points, not
wrong-and-erased. Executing it as written would have done real damage.

1. ⛔⛔ **RETIREMENT WOULD DISCARD UNIQUE LIVE CONTENT — THE BLOCKER.**
   `mempalace.yaml:215-224` holds `future_backlog_LOCKED_ROADMAP_ONLY:` — **F1…F9, nine
   concrete GUI roadmap items** *(replay timeline · "explain why" reason chain · config
   snapshot history · strategy lifecycle · reports download · journal viewer · CSV exports ·
   multi-day trend charts · unrealized/LTP)*. **No tracked file holds them** — repo-wide, the
   only tracked hits are two *pointers* and a numbering directive.
   ⚠️ **This does NOT contradict §C.4 R13's *"retiring it discards nothing unique"* — it
   BOUNDS it.** That refutation was measured about **the GUI workstream** (137 tracked files
   under `ops_dashboard/` + `G0_BACKEND_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md` + `SYSTEM_MAP.md:282`) and
   **holds for that.** It was **never measured about F1–F9**, and for F1–F9 it is **false.**
   ⭐ **The claim was right about what it checked and was then read wider than it was measured**
   — §M1 applied to our own register.
   🔴 **DECISION OWED: where F1–F9 lives after retirement.** ⛔ Until then the retirement is a
   **deletion**, and ⛔ rewriting the two pointers first would aim live files at nothing. **Not
   carried into the repo here: that is a new file, i.e. expansion, and §G3 forbids it in passing.**

2. ⛔ **`docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md` IS MISCLASSIFIED ABOVE AS A LIVE SITE.** Both its mentions are
   **dated changelog entries** — `:282` (*"G2c — VM DEPLOY (03-Jul ~17:25 IST …)"*) and `:1200`
   (*"2026-07-06 — Claude Code (Opus 4.8) — Wave-3 H-9 FIXED …"*). They are **identical in kind
   to the `docs/audit/**` dated records the bullet above excludes as history.** The *file* is
   live; **those lines are not.** ⇒ **editing them is exactly the history-rewrite §G4 exists to
   prevent.** ⭐ The scope was measured at **file** granularity while the criterion is a
   **line** property — the file-level sweep is the narrow one here.

3. ⚠️ **A FIFTH LIVE SITE THE SWEEP COULD NOT SEE:** `ops_dashboard/docs/G5e_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md:247`
   directs work to the **F-backlog (F10+ numbering)** — the same retiring destination — but
   **never says "mempalace"**, so a `mempalace`-keyed grep cannot find it. ⭐ **§M1, sharpened:
   the sweep was keyed on the NAME; the blast radius belongs to the DESTINATION.** State the
   search width — *"58 mentions of the word"* is not *"every file that depends on the thing."*

4. ⛔ **`.gitignore:82` MUST NOT SIMPLY BE DELETED.** `mempalace.yaml` is **still on disk**
   (22,585 B, 17-Jul). Dropping the ignore turns a PC-local artifact into an untracked file in
   every `git status` — noise, **and a live risk of committing it by accident.** **Retiring an
   artifact is not the same act as un-ignoring it**; the correct edit is an annotation.

✅ **NET: live sites needing an edit are `MASTER_PENDING` · `SOAK_EVIDENCE_TEMPLATE` ·
`G5e_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN` (+ `.gitignore` as an annotation only) — ⛔ NOT `SYSTEM_MAP.md`.**
⛔ **NOT a new register item — this is D5's own execution record; 231 stands.**

#### ✅✅ D5 · R13 — **UNBLOCKED AND EXECUTED, 04-Aug ~02:0x. `<BUILT>`**
🔴 **The blocker was ruled (§G2, 04-Aug):** ⭐ *"**G3 forbids FIXING things found out of scope.
Moving unique content out of a file you were authorised to retire is not a fix — it is the
PRECONDITION that makes the authorised retirement safe.**"* Read the other way D5 was
**unexecutable by construction**: retire and lose F1–F9, or don't retire and ignore the ruling.
⇒ **the migration is D5's step 1, not a separate item.**

1. ✅ **F1–F9 MIGRATED — `ops_dashboard/docs/F_BACKLOG.md` (new).** ⭐ **Proven verbatim, not
   asserted: the 9 extracted strings are `diff`-clean and md5-identical against
   `mempalace.yaml:216-224` (`53d195f7…`, 9/9).** *A migration that paraphrases is a rewrite.*
   Provenance, the source key and the date are recorded **in the file itself**, so the next
   reader does not need this register to know where it came from.
   ⛔ **Anti-duplication checked first and the rejected candidate is NAMED** (§G3 sibling): no
   roadmap/backlog home exists under `ops_dashboard/docs/` or `docs/gui_project/`; the sole
   candidate — `G5_REDESIGN_PHASE_B.md` **§SECTION K "PHASE-C IMPLEMENTATION BACKLOG"** — was
   **rejected deliberately**: an ordered list of buildable units for Phase C is a **different
   lifecycle** from a locked post-soak roadmap, and its `1./2./3.` numbering cannot host the
   **F10+** scheme both soak documents reference. ⛔ Not `MASTER_PENDING` either — roadmap
   content is not register content, and 231 is not a home for nine backlog lines.
2. ✅ **BOTH POINTERS REPOINTED** at the new home: `SOAK_EVIDENCE_TEMPLATE.md:72` (which also
   **records what it used to say**, so the change is legible per §G4) and
   `G5e_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md:247` — **the fifth site the name-keyed sweep could not see.**
3. ✅ **`.gitignore` — THE IGNORE STAYS, and now says why.** `mempalace.yaml` is still on disk
   (22,585 B) and PC-local; dropping the line would surface it as untracked in every
   `git status` and **risk committing it by accident.** ⛔ **Retiring an artifact is not the same
   act as making it committable.** Verified after the edit with `git check-ignore -v` — still
   ignored (`.gitignore:88`), still untracked.
4. ⛔ **`SYSTEM_MAP.md` DELIBERATELY UNTOUCHED** — both mentions are dated changelog entries.
   Editing them is the §G4 rewrite. **The file is live; those lines are not.**
5. 🔴 **D5's TAIL, OPEN AND NOT BLOCKING:** `venv/Scripts/mempalace.exe` stays **installed**.
   Uninstalling a CLI is a different risk class and nothing depends on its timing.
6. ✅ **THE EXTERNAL CARD-TEMPLATE HALF IS CLOSED — AT SOURCE, WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE IT COULD
   BE.** Cards live outside the repo by standing rule, so no repo sweep could ever have reached
   them. **Closed by the card author (§G2, 04-Aug-2026): *"From this card onward it is gone from
   my headers; I will not write `mempalace` into a memory-update directive again."***
   ⛔ **HISTORICAL cards keep the reference and MUST NOT be chased** — they are
   **correct-as-history**, exactly like the ~24 archive mentions in the scope block above.
   ⚠️ Recorded as **closed-at-source rather than left open against the repo**: an item no repo
   action can discharge, logged as outstanding here, decays into a permanent false TODO.

⭐ **THE RULE THIS EARNED: `campaign_practices.md` §M5 — *a measurement's conclusion may not be
wider than its subject*,** with all three of D5's joins as its worked instances.

### ✅ THE CLAUDE-AGENT CONFIGURATION — **MEASURED 04-Aug 00:0x. ⭐ THE FLAGGED CLAIM SURVIVED.**
The card flagged its own *"4 heartbeat cron lines governed by `~/tools/claude/AGENTS.md`"* as
**seeded from conversation, not measured (M3)**. **Measured on the VM, it is CORRECT** — and it
is worth recording that a self-flagged suspect claim *held*, because the discipline is only
credible if it also confirms:
- ✅ **Exactly 4 cron lines** — 05:30 · 10:31 · 15:32 · 20:33 daily — all running the *same*
  trivial prompt (*"Generate a random 8-character string"*) into `~/tools/claude/cron.log`.
- ✅ **`~/tools/claude/AGENTS.md` EXISTS** (1,270 B, 23-Jun) — a real charter: *"You are NOT an
  operator of the trading system"*, with hard prohibitions mirroring AGY governance.
- ✅ **Its enforcement claim is TRUE.** ⚠️ **I nearly filed the opposite as a finding:**
  `~/.claude/settings.json` is 42 bytes (`theme`+`model` only, no deny list) — but the
  charter means the **project-level** file, and `~/tools/claude/.claude/settings.json` carries
  a real **14-rule `permissions.deny`** (no `.py` writes/edits · no `.db` read/write ·
  no `sqlite3`/`systemctl`/`sudo`/`service` · no `git push` · no writes to `~/systems/**` ·
  no `.env` reads). ⭐ **Second too-narrow check of the night** (the first was the post-push
  grep). Same lesson, same session: **state the search width, then widen before reporting.**
- ✅ **Governed, not stray** — the 4 jobs are registered in `config/cron_registry.yaml`.
- ✅ **Claude has NO production role on the VM.** The trading-system assistant work is **agy
  (Google/Gemini)**: 5 cron jobs — `gemini_premarket_brief` · `gemini_trade_coach` ·
  `gemini_log_review` · `gemini_weekly_patterns` · `gemini_data_integrity_check`.
- ⚠️⚠️ **DISCLOSED, NOT FIXED (§G3), and outside the trading system entirely: THE HEARTBEAT IS
  DEAD.** `cron.log` = 185 lines: **112 successful 8-char outputs, then 46
  `Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 OAuth access token has expired.`** At 4 runs/day that
  is **≈11–12 days of continuous failure**; ⛔ the log carries **no timestamps**, so the exact
  onset is **not readable from it** — stated rather than estimated as fact. **Severity LOW**
  (sandbox charter, no production role, its own deny list) — but the point stands: **a
  heartbeat that fails is a heartbeat that proves nothing**, and nothing alerted on it for
  ~11 days because it sits **outside the trading system's alert path altogether.**

⭐ **THE CALENDAR, RESTATED ONCE SO NOTHING BELOW HAS TO BE INFERRED (authority: R2):**
| day | what happens |
|---|---|
| **MON 3-AUG** | observation day on `297b587` · PC gates (#1 composition boot · #2 kill drill · calm regression confirm) · observation query at close · **18:15+ push CODE + DOCS ONLY**, book flat, **Rama flattens MANUALLY** |
| **TUE 4-AUG** | ⭐ **SHAKEDOWN DAY — a real role, not an empty gap:** one additional clean observation day, **the first real EOD census** that evening, the buy-day filter **dormant-armed**. Then **push the flip flags + the R4 registry edits** |
| **WED 5-AUG** | ⭐ **THE FLIP** |

⛔ **Every "Tue 4-Aug flip" / "the 4-Aug flip" phrasing anywhere below or in any other
document is SUPERSEDED BY R2 and now means WED 5-AUG.** The **4-Aug date itself is NOT
deleted** — it is reassigned to the **shakedown day + the flip-flag push**, which is why
this is a *resequencing*, not drift. ⭐ **Where a date moved, R2 is the reason.**

⛔ **These are DECISIONS, not accepted risks — they are deliberately NOT filed in
`campaign_practices.md` §R.** If any of them later has a risk accepted as part of it, that
becomes its own AR entry with a reopen condition and a SHA-pinned source.

---

## ⭐⭐ A-DEC-3 — **THE SETTLED SHAPE FOR PIPELINE-SCOPED RISK CONTROL — recorded 04-Aug-2026.** ⛔ SHAPE ONLY. **NOTHING HERE IS AUTHORISED, DESIGNED OR BUILT**, and no register row is created — **231 stands.**

> ⚠️ **M5 — the subject, beside the conclusion:** this block records **how a control must be DESCRIBED and ENFORCED**, derived from the 04-Aug two-pipeline and capital measurements (§B#7, §C.1 G8/G2/G3). It does **not** set a single delivery value, and it does **not** re-measure anything above it.
> ✅ **R1–R5 (A-DEC) and D1–D7 (A-DEC-2) are current as recorded and are NOT amended here.** R2's Wed-5-Aug resequencing is now reflected in the currency block and A2; R4's registry edits **shipped with the flip**; R10 remains open and is now measured as **behaviourally a no-op under BOTH** (§A2).
>
> ### 1. ⭐ THE ANNOTATION — every control carries FIVE axes, and STATUS is a SIXTH kept SEPARATE
> **SCOPE** (GLOBAL safety rule · pipeline-local · strategy-local) · **BASIS** (what it measures: notional · margin · realised cash · count) · **DENOMINATOR** (total capital · bucket · position) · **MODE** (observe · enforce) · **WHY** (the incident or reasoning it exists for).
> ⛔⛔ **STATUS (active · placeholder · reserved) IS A SEPARATE AXIS AND MUST STAY SEPARATE FROM MODE. `ENFORCE + PLACEHOLDER` IS THE DANGEROUS CELL — a control that is enforcing a value nobody chose — and it only becomes VISIBLE if the two axes are kept apart.** Collapse them and that cell is unnameable.
> ⭐ **Earned, not invented:** `max_sector_exposure_pct` reads *"40% of capital"* exactly like `max_position_value_pct` and measures a **different quantity** (§C.1 G3) — a BASIS/DENOMINATOR annotation would have made that visible on the line.
>
> ### 2. ⭐ THE CODE RULE — one sentence, and it is checkable
> **Any query or governor that touches `trades` must either CONSULT the pipeline dimension or DECLARE ITSELF GLOBAL.** A control with no declared scope is how the next feature inherits the wrong behaviour.
> ⛔ **The routing ALREADY EXISTS — `position_sizer.py:291` (re-measured at HEAD 04-Aug): `bucket = "intraday" if intent in _INTRADAY_INTENTS else "positional"`. DO NOT ADD A SECOND SOURCE OF TRUTH.** Every coupling in §B#7 is a query that simply takes no such argument.
>
> ### 3. ⭐ THE TAXONOMY HAS NO HOME FOR **MODIFIERS**, AND THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO
> The five axes describe **caps**. The **tier multiplier** is applied **after** the caps (`raw_qty × tier_multiplier`) and has **no entry anywhere in any inventory** — yet it is a permanent ×0.5 on 438/438 trades. ⚠️ **`dynamic_by_winrate` (min 0.5 / max 2.0, `system_config.yaml:182-184`) is a SECOND modifier, equally uninventoried** — and unlike the tier it can move size in **both** directions.
> ⇒ **A modifier is not a cap and must not be filed as one; it needs its own row-shape.**
>
> ### 4. ⭐ ENFORCEMENT = A PIPELINE-ISOLATION SUITE, AND IT MUST BE BORN FAILING
> **Seed it with H1 and H5 as its FIRST TWO TESTS, written NOW, RED.** ⛔ **Written after the fixes they would pass on day one and prove nothing** — the vacuous-test failure this campaign has hit repeatedly (IA-XTEST-01, practices §V4).
> ⭐ **Plus a test that FAILS if any modifier applies to 100% of trades without an explicit acknowledgement flag** — that single test would have caught the tier ladder, and would catch the next permanent-haircut-wearing-a-ladder-label.
>
> ### 5. ⚠️ A CAPITAL-AFFECTING CHANGE NEEDS A WIND-DOWN PLAN
> **A config revert restores the VALUE, not the POSITIONS.** Any change that can open positions must state, before it ships, how existing positions are wound down if it is reverted. *(Delivery makes this sharper than intraday ever did: EOD6 does not close CNC.)*
>
> ### 6. ⭐ ADD A **GOVERNANCE** BAND — and the prioritisation rule that goes with it
> Governance improvements (the annotation, the code rule, the isolation suite, the wind-down requirement) have been mixing into **§C alongside implementation defects**. ⛔ **Separate queues, so priority is never accidentally swapped** — a governance item and a live money-path defect are not comparable and should never sit in one ranking.
> ⛔⛔ **DEFECTS ARE PRIORITISED BY EXPOSURE AND REACHABILITY, NOT BY EFFORT.** *(The campaign has twice had a "cheap to fix" label do the ranking — §B#6 and §B#3 both carry a struck "~2 lines".)*
>
> ### 7. ⏰ THE ORDER — and it is an ORDER, not a list
> **1.** ⭐ **WEDNESDAY'S FLIP OBSERVATION — it outranks everything in this block.** It cannot be re-run; all of this can.
> **2.** **H1 + H5** — the only two couplings that are LIVE from the first delivery fill.
> **3.** **Persist the broker margin** (both timestamps: at reserve, and a mid-session sample) — the cheapest change that makes any future divergence detectable at all (§B#5).
> **4.** **Annotate the Part A inventory** with the five axes + STATUS. ⛔⛔ **EXTEND THE EXISTING INVENTORY — DO NOT CREATE A SECOND CONTROL INVENTORY.** Two inventories is the multi-authority defect (§B#7) committed deliberately, by the very work meant to cure it.
> **5.** **Draft the delivery configuration surface as PLACEHOLDERS** — ⭐ **Rama's instruction: create the SURFACE, do not tune the VALUES; tune from production evidence later.** Delivery settings are built **from the intraday template**, not invented — which is why the inventory (4) is a hard prerequisite, and why any delivery value set before it would be exactly the "blind settings" being refused.
> **6.** **The concentration / tier replay** — what would the book have done at a different `max_concentration_pct` and an unpinned tier? (§C.1 G8's ~7% utilisation is the question this answers.)
> **7.** **THEN the deployment decision.** ⛔ Not before 6.

### 🏷️ SUB-ENTRY ON ITEM **4** — THE 05-Aug DESIGN THREAD, FILED SO IT STOPS BEING RE-DERIVED
### ⛔⛔ **`RECOMMENDED — NOT RULED`. RAMA HAS NOT CHOSEN THE AUTHORITY.** ⛔ No new register row; **231 stands.**

> ⭐ **Why this block exists:** *"we've revisited several of these ideas multiple times."* **An idea
> that has to be re-derived is an idea the project does not actually own.** A four-round design
> thread produced these conclusions and they existed **only in chat**, which is not a record.
> ⚠️ **AND ITEM 4's OWN PREMISE IS ALREADY KNOWN FALSE:** step 1 measured that **"Part A" does not
> exist** and that **TWO control inventories do** (record:
> `docs/audit/item4_partA_inventory_survey_05aug2026.md`). ⇒ **item 4 BEGINS WITH A RECONCILIATION,
> not an annotation** — item 4's wording at `:368` above is superseded by that measurement (§G4:
> struck-through in effect, kept legible because the instruction is the historical record).

**RECOMMENDED AUTHORITY — inventory #2 (`G2a_capacity_inventory.md`), as SHAPE AND KEY,
⛔ NOT NECESSARILY LOCATION.** Four criteria, each a reason and not a preference:
1. it has a **live consumer** (`capacity.py`) ⇒ **it cannot rot unnoticed**;
2. it is keyed on the **dotted key**, not a prose name;
3. its **SCOPE axis is already populated**;
4. **#1 is a section inside a dated 05-Jul audit report** ⇒ extending it would **edit dated history**.

⚠️ **CAVEAT, NOT A BLOCKER:** `ops_dashboard/` is a **subsystem home for a system-wide authority** —
the same shape as the `CT_SCRATCH_DIR`-inside-`data_store/` finding.
⛔⛔ **AUTHORITY, LOCATION AND MIGRATION PLAN ARE THREE SEPARATE RULINGS AND ARE NEVER BUNDLED** — ⭐
**if a bundle fails you cannot tell which part failed.**

**SEQUENCE (each step gates the next):**
`authority` → **STATUS validation (+ ownership)** → **row identity** *(step 2.5 —
`locked_decisions.yaml`'s 181 `LOCKED` may already supply one)* → `reconciliation` → **freeze #1
with a pointer** → **then item 5.**

**THE ROW CONTRACT — the parts that are structural rather than stylistic:**
- **THREE IDENTITY FIELDS, NEVER ONE:** **Row ID** (immutable) · **dotted key** (current
  implementation reference) · **display name** (presentation only).
  ⛔ **Nothing joins on the display name; nothing infers identity from the dotted key.**
- **ALIASES ARE FOR RENAMES ONLY** — append-only, each with **date + SHA**.
  🔴 **A change of SCOPE, DENOMINATOR, BASIS or BEHAVIOUR is a NEW ROW**, the old one `RETIRED` and
  pointing at it. ⭐ *Otherwise a 40%-of-**total** silently becomes 40%-of-**bucket** and nobody can
  find the moment it changed.*
- **RETIRED ROWS ARE NEVER DELETED** — `status=RETIRED` + date + SHA. ⭐ *"This control existed,
  enforced X, was removed on D"* **is evidence**, and historical citations still resolve — to a row
  that says RETIRED.
- **PROVENANCE PER IMPORTED ROW:** source inventory · import SHA · migration date ·
  **`verified_at_sha` + `verified_on` + verifier (`human` / `tool:<name>`)**.
  ⛔ **NOT A BOOLEAN** — ⭐ **a date says when someone looked; only a SHA says what they looked at.**
  ⚠️ *(The card's supporting figure — "we are 33 commits ahead of deployed" — **has already rotted**.
  ⛔ Never quote an ahead-count from prose; re-measure: `git rev-list --count origin/main..main`.)*
- **CONFLICT TAXONOMY:** `documentation error` · `implementation drift` · `intentional divergence` ·
  `insufficient evidence`.
  ⛔ **NEVER DRIVE CONFLICTS TO ZERO** — where the two inventories disagree, **one has been wrong in
  production for months, and WHICH is a MEASUREMENT.**
  🔴 **`intentional divergence` must name WHO decided, WHEN, and WHERE it is recorded — otherwise it
  is `insufficient evidence` wearing a better coat.**
  ⭐ *(It is the four finding-buckets specialised to a migration — ⛔ **not a new scheme.**)*
- **THE RECONCILIATION SUMMARY MUST BALANCE ARITHMETICALLY**, with the **expected equation printed
  in the document beside its result.** ⛔ **Print both sides AND the difference even when it is
  zero** *(M6's corollary: a printed zero is a measurement, an absent one is silence).*

⭐ **THE ARGUMENT FOR DOING ITEM 4 AT ALL, IN ONE LINE — and it is now evidenced, not asserted:**
inventory #1's **row 24 already carried the G3 drift control AND its non-escalating source.** What it
lacked was **SCOPE and DENOMINATOR** — ⭐⭐ **the two axes that would have shown the 10% band is an
*intraday-leverage* calibration.** ⇒ **THE MISSING AXES WOULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS MORNING'S CAPITAL-
DRIFT `CRITICAL` BEFORE IT FIRED.**

⚠️ **OPEN AND UNCHECKED — carried forward, ⛔ not answered here:** do `[LAUNCH-PHASE]` /
`[PERMANENT]` and `locked_decisions.yaml` already constitute the **STATUS** axis — and ⭐ **is either
tag ever READ BY CODE, or are they comments?** *(This is the **ownership test** applied to the
inventory's own STATUS column — see `campaign_practices.md` §M10.)*

---

## ~~⚠️⚠️ A0 — THE ONE OPEN DECISION OWED TO RAMA~~ → ✅ **CLOSED 02-Aug-2026 BY R1: THE GATE IS 3-PART.**

> ✅ **ANSWERED — the THREE-part reading wins** (Rama's earlier lean, ratified): a
> buy-day-filter slip **postpones ALL of the flip**, not merely the carry pilot. The gate
> is *observation ran · came back clean · **filter shipped***.
> ⭐ **Decided BEFORE the query, exactly as both sources demanded** — *"otherwise tonight's
> result gets read through whichever answer is more convenient"* — so the reason this
> mattered was honoured, not just the deadline. **The question below is kept legible (§G4)
> as the record of what was decided and against what alternative; it is NOT open work.**

### ~~The original open question, preserved:~~ ***Did a buy-day-product-filter SLIP postpone only the carry pilot, or all of the flip?***

> ### Does a buy-day-product-filter SLIP postpone **only the carry pilot**, or **all of 4-Aug**?

**SOURCE:** S4 §7.9(f) + S4 line 287 · S5 lines 103–116 · S2 §1 (`⚠️ OPEN (§7.9(f))`).
**WHY-PENDING:** the two readings share the same deadline, so nothing moves *today* —
**they differ only if the filter slips**, which is exactly the case now in play.

| reading | if the filter slips, then… | where it is recorded |
|---|---|---|
| **TWO-part gate** *(as recorded in S4/S2)* | the **four flags still flip Tue 4-Aug**; only the **carry pilot** waits. | S4 line 285–286: *"THE GATE HAS TWO PARTS TODAY, NOT THREE"* |
| **THREE-part gate** *(Rama's earlier lean)* | a filter slip **postpones ALL of 4-Aug** — observation ran · came back clean · **filter shipped**. | S4 §7.9(f): *"tonight's instruction described the flip's hard gate as THREE-part"* |

✅ ~~⛔⛔ **DECIDE IT BEFORE MONDAY'S CLOSE — not after the query.**~~ **DONE — decided
02-Aug, before Monday opened.** Both sources gave the same reason and it was the whole
point: *"otherwise tonight's result gets read through whichever answer is more
convenient."* (S5:114-116; S4:1062 *"Do not resolve this by picking one on the day."*)
⇒ **R1 chose the THREE-part reading.**

⚠️ **THE MATERIAL FACT THE DECISION NOW HAS THAT IT DID NOT HAVE ON 31-JUL:** the
filter's *"honest window"* was **this weekend, Sat 1-Aug / Sun 2-Aug** (S4:1054, S5:109)
— **and this file is a register build, so the filter is not being built in it.** ⇒ the
slip case is no longer hypothetical; it is the live branch unless the filter lands
Sunday. **This file does not resolve that either — it states it.**

## A1 — MON 3-AUG OBSERVATION DAY `<DEPLOYED, awaiting VERIFIED LIVE>`

**SOURCE:** S5 (the card, authority) · S4 lines 255–282 · S2 §1.
**WHY-PENDING:** the symbol+direction rule went live at the 31-Jul push (`297b587`,
21:44:48, verified 3 ways, `load_all` OK) and **has never executed in production.**
Monday is its first market day. ⛔ **BUILD NOTHING MONDAY — it is a measurement.**

- **What is live:** `risk.one_trade_per_symbol_direction_per_day: true` →
  `signals/signal_processor.py::_enforce_one_trade_per_symbol_direction` → writes
  `signals.status = REJECTED_SYMBOL_DIRECTION_DAILY_LIMIT`. All three entry paths
  (gate / main / retest), each inside `portfolio_lock` immediately before `approve()`.
  **No bypass.**
- **The query is in S5 lines 43–56. ⛔ Do not rewrite it.** The status list
  (`PENDING_FILL, OPEN, PARTIAL, EXITING, CLOSED, CLOSED_MANUAL`) **is not negotiable** —
  a query written on `status='CLOSED'` would report **correctly-working** rejections as
  UNEXPLAINED and could postpone 4-Aug for no reason at all.
- **READ EACH ROW:** named direction ≥1 ⇒ ✅ rule working · **both counts 0 ⇒ 🔴
  UNEXPLAINED, POSTPONES 4-AUG** · **only the OPPOSITE direction ≥1 ⇒ 🔴 WORSE — the rule
  blocked a REVERSAL, postpones 4-Aug AND the rule comes back off.**
- ⭐⭐ **ZERO ROWS IS NOT A PASS** (S5:79-94). It means the rule was never *exercised*.
  Read it as **NO EVIDENCE**, say so out loud on the night, and **prove the day had
  signal traffic first** (S5's second query) — a day with no signals proves nothing.
- ⚠️ **EXPECTED, NOT FINDINGS:** the `REJECTED_NOT_MIS_TRADABLE (shadow)` WARNING (the
  mis_filter shadow log — **nothing was dropped**; ⛔ anyone reading it as the filter
  *enforcing* will "fix" a working system) · **no migration at the 08:15 boot**
  (`EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged at 45 — **a migration line WOULD be a finding**).

### A1(z) — 📌 THE ZERO-CASE CARRY-FORWARD
**SOURCE:** S5:85-87. **WHY-PENDING:** if Monday returns zero rows, the rule enters 4-Aug
**still unexercised in production** — the *configured-but-never-covered* shape, which is
this audit's dominant defect class (S3 verdict). ⛔ **Carry it forward as an OPEN
observation, never as a closed one.** Cross-ref: **IA-XARCH-01 / IA-XCFG-02 / IA-XTEST-01**
(§B#1) — the same class, and the mechanism that would close it.

> ### ✅ STATUS SUPERSEDED 04-Aug (§G4 — the `<PENDING>` above is struck, not deleted, because the gate sequence that cleared it is the record)
> **All 10 gates ran in order; none skipped.** 1 census clean · 2 the 18:00 drift WARNING matched `expected_alarms` §5a exactly (names exactly the 4 claude heartbeats, arrives as WARNING) · 3 **after 18:15 and the book FLAT — proven WIDE:** *every* trade row in the DB is terminal (FAILED 221 / CLOSED 167 / REJECTED 59 / CLOSED_MANUAL 45 / CANCELLED 9), no OPEN/EXITING/PENDING_FILL on **any** date; `gtt_state` **0 rows** · 4 service `inactive`, `Result=success`, `NRestarts=0`, one continuous run 08:15:09→17:35:04 · 5 forward-shadow banked 18:17, **exactly ONE new date, no contamination** · 6 **D2 SHA inventory 27/27** · 7 tree clean · 8 `ls-remote` · 9 **full gate PASS, sets not counts** · 10 push.
> ⭐ **THE THREE-PART GATE (R1) WAS SATISFIED, NOT WAIVED:** A1 ran, came back clean, and **A4 (the buy-day filter) was live** — it rode the 03-Aug push.
> ✅ **VERIFIED AT THE DEPLOYED TREE, not the bare HEAD:** all 7 changed files **md5-identical PC vs VM**; live values grepped on the VM (`force_intraday_only: false` `:89` · `trade_type: BOTH` `:96` · `delivery_enabled: true` `:102`); both `cnc_gtt_*` read `expected-event-driven`; deploy reflog shows **BOTH halves** at 19:08:09 (`push` **and** `checkout`). ⭐ **Zero schema change CONFIRMED (`core/schema.sql` diff = 0 lines)** ⇒ the evening-schema-push overnight-CRITICAL hazard did not apply.
> ⚠️ **ONE DEVIATION FROM THE PLAN, RECORDED BECAUSE IT WAS A JUDGMENT CALL RAMA COULD HAVE REVERSED (he ruled "push now"):** gate 9 surfaced **one** new failure — `test_slice2_strategy_control.py::TestSchemaConfig::test_trade_type_default_intraday`, whose body asserted `load_all(_CFG).system.trade_type == "INTRADAY"` (**the SHIPPED VALUE**) while its name **and its class `TestSchemaConfig`, every sibling of which asserts a schema property**, promise the **DEFAULT**. ⭐ **§"no fixed number where a property is meant" — exposed BY the flip, not caused by it.** Measured before touching: default still `INTRADAY` (`config_loader.py:1761`), omit-key construct still `INTRADAY` ⇒ **the property is unchanged; only the deployed value moved.** ⛔ The old body **could not have gone red if the DEFAULT itself changed** — the one failure its name describes. Corrected to assert the property; final gate **9F/5,549P/4skip vs BASE 9F/5,549P/4skip, `comm` EMPTY both ways.** ⛔ A test file ships to the VM and **never executes there**, which is why it did not violate the card's "no implementation" rule (whose stated rationale is *"all first execute on flip morning"*).
> ⚠️ **`conditional_allocation_enabled` (R10) DELIBERATELY NOT FLIPPED** — `config_auditor.py:258-262` states that with both intents active it returns the **SAME split as false** ⇒ a **no-op under BOTH**, and the delivery-only case that would make it matter is guarded by **A5 at Severity.BLOCK**. ⛔ The register's *"~70% of capital strands"* premise assumes a **delivery-only** book, which is not what was deployed. **Rama's call remains open; it is simply not urgent.**
> 🔴 **STILL OWED AND NOT CLOSED BY THE PUSH:** the four flags listed below said "four" — **the fourth was `conditional_allocation_enabled`, and `trade_type` was the one nobody listed.** Both facts are now recorded above.

> ### 🔌🕳️⭐⭐ THE BOOT CHAIN — **TRACED 05-Aug. NOTHING IN CRON STARTS THE SERVICE, AND THE REGISTER HAS NEVER SAID OTHERWISE *BECAUSE IT HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING***
> **THE MECHANISM, measured at HEAD:** `trading-system.service` is **`WantedBy=multi-user.target`** (VM-boot only) with **`Restart=on-failure`** + **`RestartPreventExitStatus=3 4`** ⇒ ⛔ **a clean exit 0 NEVER self-restarts**, which is why the 17:35 self-exit is terminal for the day. The actual starter is **`token-watcher.service` → `deploy/token_watcher.sh` (FIX-188), running since 28-Jul**, `Environment=SLEEP_SEC=30` (unit `:11`; script default `:21` agrees), guarded by **`within_service_window()` — `hour ≥ 8 and < 16`** (`:47-50`, FIX-189) and by the prior-day-exit disposition. **The 08:15 cron writes the TOKEN FILE and nothing else.**
> ⭐ **WHY THIS IS RECORDED AS A FINDING RATHER THAN A CORRECTION — and the width is stated so the claim is falsifiable (§"an absence needs a check wide enough to have found the thing"):** a grep of this register for `token_watcher|token-watcher|token file|zerodha_token` returns **0 hits**, and for `cron.*boot|boot.*cron` **0 hits**, against **14** occurrences of `08:15`. ⇒ ⛔ **The register never asserted that cron starts the service — it treated "the 08:15 boot" as an ATOMIC EVENT with no named mechanism.** That is not a false claim; **it is an unexamined one**, and it is precisely how the single point of failure below stayed unregistered through a whole campaign. **Another declared-vs-actual gap found by measuring rather than by reading.**
> 🔴🔴 **THE CONSEQUENCE, AND IT IS THE REASON THIS BLOCK EXISTS: A FAILED TOKEN REFRESH PRODUCES SILENCE — NO BOOT, NO ERROR, NO ALERT, NO CRITICAL.** ⇒ ⛔ **"no delivery order today" and "the service never started" are INDISTINGUISHABLE unless the token file is checked FIRST.** ⚠️ **AND THE OBVIOUS SECOND CHECK DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR IT:** `logs/cron-auto-token.log` **logs only on abnormality** (no write in 8 days) ⇒ **silence there is SUCCESS, so an unchanged log is NOT proof of a refresh.** ⭐ **The token FILE — `data_store/session/zerodha_token.json`, present AND `date` == today — is the gate; the log is not.**
> ⇒ 📌 **REGISTERED AS: A SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE WITH NO ALARM ON IT.** ⛔ **DO NOT FIX IT — REGISTER IT.** It is unauthorised work, it sits on the boot path, and today is flip day. *(Sibling of G1's 95-minute unwatched window: both are **absence-of-signal** holes, where the healthy state and the dead state emit the same thing — nothing.)* ⚠️ **SYSTEM_MAP entry OWED** (memory `boot_chain_token_watcher_05aug.md`); ⛔ not written here, because this register is not the map.
> ⚠️ **A PREDICTION OF MINE CORRECTED IN THE RECORD, because left standing it would have made a NORMAL boot look wrong EVERY DAY:** I wrote *"expect `active` ~08:15:30–08:16"*. ⛔ **That was the PESSIMISTIC END of the poll window, quoted as if it were the window.** With a **30 s** poll and the token landing at `:01.910`, the service start is distributed **~08:15:02–08:15:32, roughly uniformly** — so **08:15:05 is a FAST DRAW, not an anomaly**, and a start at `:30` is equally normal. ⭐ **A one-sided bound restated as an expectation converts the whole low half of a normal distribution into false findings.**

> ### ✅⭐⭐⭐ (a) IS **ANSWERED** — **DELIVERY PLACED AND FILLED. THE FLIP WORKED END TO END ON THE ENTRY PATH.**
> **REPORTED 05-Aug intraday: TWO CNC positions are open at the broker**, product `CNC`, one of them tagged `HOLDING`, with a GTT reported accepted shortly after. ⇒ ⭐⭐ **THE QUESTION THE WHOLE FLIP WAS BUILT TO ANSWER IS CLOSED AFFIRMATIVELY**, and it goes far past this morning's `will_trade` permission: **screening · sizing · affordability · placement · FILL all cleared.** The 04-Aug worry that the flip might be a no-op that looked complete is now refuted twice over — **once by permission at 08:15, once by a filled position.**
> ⚠️⚠️ **PROVENANCE — STATED FIRST, BECAUSE IT DECIDES WHAT THIS BLOCK IS ALLOWED TO CLAIM: THIS IS OPERATOR-REPORTED FROM A KITE SCREENSHOT, ⛔ NOT MEASURED.** ⛔ **NO FIGURE BELOW HAS BEEN VERIFIED AGAINST THE DB OR THE BROKER FROM HERE, AND NONE IS RECORDED AS IF IT HAD BEEN.** The reason is measurable rather than assumed: the PC's `data_store/trading_system.db` carries **mtime 2026-08-03 16:08** — **two days stale, predating both the flip push (04-Aug 19:08) and this morning's boot** ⇒ **it cannot contain a single row from today**, and the standing rule ⛔ **never `scripts/*.py --db <copy>`** forecloses the copy route regardless. ⇒ ⭐ **This entry is a PROMPT TO MEASURE that records what is known and names what is not — it is exactly the seeded-from-conversation shape that has repeatedly produced false findings in this campaign, and it is labelled rather than laundered.**
> 📏 **THE CONFIRMATION QUANTITY IS *TODAY'S TOTAL CNC VALUE*, ⛔ NOT SYMBOL NAMES — and that is a deliberate choice, not squeamishness.** A total is **checkable against one number** (`SUM(qty × avg)` across CNC positions, broker vs DB), it **survives a second fill or a partial exit** in a way a name list does not, and it **keeps position-level identifiers out of a document that is read, quoted and copied.** ⇒ **Record and reconcile the TOTAL; the per-symbol detail lives in the DB and the broker, which are the authorities anyway.**
>
> #### 🔬 OWED TONIGHT — **THE MEASUREMENTS THAT TURN THIS BLOCK FROM REPORTED INTO RECORDED** *(each must cite what it read)*
> **(i) THE POSITION SET.** Count of CNC positions · ⭐ **today's TOTAL CNC value** — computed **both** at the broker and from `trades`, and **reconciled against each other** (a divergence is itself the finding) · per-row `product`, `qty`, entry, timestamp, strategy, `trade_id` **read into the DB record, summarised as a total here.**
> **(ii) ⭐⭐ SCORE THE PREDICTION EXPLICITLY — RIGHT OR WRONG.** The prediction on record was **affordability binds before the 40% position-value cap**, on the scale-free ground that the cap is **40% of TOTAL** while the positional bucket is **30% of TOTAL** (above). ⛔⛔ **AND THE SCORING METHOD IS NOT "READ `binding_constraint`" — MEASURED AT HEAD, THAT LABEL CANNOT SETTLE IT:** `position_sizer.py:427-437` comments **"CAPITAL wins on tie (most conservative), then RISK"**, so `constraint = "CAPITAL"` is **also what a THREE-WAY TIE reports.** ⇒ ⭐ **Compare the three persisted candidates in `breakdown` — `qty_by_risk` · `qty_by_capital` · `qty_by_concentration` (`:441-443`) — and score on which was STRICTLY the minimum**, which is precisely the method §C.1 G8(4) already used to get "strictly the min = 0 on 438/438". **The "never classify by free text" rule, applied to our own evidence.**
> ⚠️ **AND CHECK THE FLOOR BEFORE CREDITING ANY CAP, because at qty 1 it is the likeliest decider:** `raw_qty = min(...)` then **`tiered_qty = floor(raw_qty × tier_multiplier)`** at the measured permanent **`tier 0.5`** ⇒ **`raw_qty = 1` floors to 0 and FIX-133's floor lifts it back to 1** (`:466-476`). ⇒ **If `raw_qty` was 1 or 2, the final qty was decided by the TIER AND ITS FLOOR, not by any cap, and the `binding_constraint` label describes `raw_qty`'s `min()` — NOT the quantity that was actually ordered.** ⛔ **Say that instead, if that is what the breakdown shows.** ⭐ **Note the asymmetry that makes the prediction well-founded in the first place: `qty_by_capital` divides the BUCKET (`:419-420`, `avail`), while risk and concentration both scale `total_capital` (`:382`, `:423-424`).**
> **(iii) ⭐⭐ THE FIRST `gtt_state` ROW THIS SYSTEM HAS EVER WRITTEN IN PRODUCTION** (the table held **0 rows**): its **`status`**, its **`trade_id`**, and its **write timestamp** — ⛔ **and `trade_id` is not optional detail; §C.5's gate turns on it** (below).

> ### ⚖️ THE CEILING, HELD HONESTLY — **⛔ THIS IS *NOT* A BLANKET `<VERIFIED LIVE>` FOR DELIVERY**
> **A position that FILLED proves the ENTRY path.** ⛔ **The EXIT path is entirely unproven: the GTT actually triggering · T+1 handling · the carry.** ⇒ **§A2 is relabelled to `<ENTRY PATH VERIFIED LIVE; EXIT PATH UNVERIFIED>`** — ⭐ **the same discipline that produced this morning's compound label, applied again rather than relaxed because the news is good.** *(⚠️ M5 — what this does not cover: nothing here re-measures the boot, and no exit, trigger or T+1 event has been observed at all.)*
> ⭐ **THE TESTABLE PREDICTION, RECORDED BEFORE THE FACT SO IT CAN BE SCORED — and re-measured at HEAD, not recalled:** with `delivery_risk_per_trade_pct` / `delivery_max_position_value_pct` both **`null`** (`system_config.yaml:190-191`), `position_sizer.py:305-308` routes the positional bucket to the **GLOBAL** values ⇒ the position-value cap is **40%** (`:139`). ⛔ **AND ITS BASE IS `total_capital`, NOT THE BUCKET — `:585` `max_position_value = eff_max_position_value_pct * total_capital`**, the same base already measured for the RISK leg at §C.1 G8(4). ⇒ **cap = 0.40 × ₹9,883.70 = ₹3,953.48 against a positional bucket of ₹2,965.11 ⇒ AFFORDABILITY SHOULD BIND FIRST, NOT THE 40% CAP.** ⭐⭐ **AND STATE IT SCALE-FREE, PER THE DENOMINATOR DISCIPLINE (§C.2 G18(a-i)), BECAUSE THE RUPEE FORM EXPIRES TONIGHT AND THE RATIO DOES NOT: the cap is 40% of TOTAL while the whole positional bucket is 30% of TOTAL ⇒ 0.40 > 0.30 ⇒ THE POSITION-VALUE CAP CANNOT BIND ON A POSITIONAL ENTRY AT ANY CAPITAL while the 70/30 split holds.** ⇒ 🔴 **IF SOMETHING ELSE BINDS, THAT IS A FINDING** — and if `POSITION_VALUE_CAP` binds, the finding is **structural**, not a tuning surprise.
> ⚠️⚠️ **A LATENT MISLABEL FOUND WHILE MEASURING THE ABOVE — ⛔ DISCLOSED, NOT FIXED, NOT A NEW ROW (§G3; 231 stands), AND IT IS THE `ENFORCE + PLACEHOLDER` CELL OF §A-DEC-3 §1 ARRIVING IN REAL CODE:** `position_sizer.py:585` **enforces** `eff_max_position_value_pct`, but the CRITICAL log at **`:596`** and the rejection reason at **`:609`** both report **`self._max_position_value_pct` — the GLOBAL**. **Today they are identical** (the delivery override is `null`), which is exactly why nothing is broken and exactly why this is invisible. ⛔ **The moment `delivery_max_position_value_pct` is set — which is A-DEC-3 order item 5, the delivery configuration surface — the operator-facing CRITICAL will state a percentage that was NOT the one enforced.** ⭐ **Same family as `capital_at_risk` and `sl_distance_pct` (§C.2 G18(b)): a name reporting a quantity it does not hold.** ⇒ **it is not a bug today; it is a TRAP LAID FOR ITEM 5, and it must be closed BY item 5, not after it.** *(LATENT ⇒ document and continue, per the LIVE-vs-LATENT rule.)*
> **(b) ~17:35 — THE SHUTDOWN CENSUS. ⛔ THE ONE ARTIFACT THAT CANNOT BE RE-RUN** (it emits at `_shutdown()` and is gone if the service is disturbed). 🔴 **If delivery TRADED and `cnc_gtt_placer`/`cnc_gtt_monitor` still read `acted 0`, THAT IS A FINDING** — R4 moved both to `expected-event-driven` precisely so this reads as a mismatch rather than as design. ⭐⭐ **AND AS OF (a) THIS IS NO LONGER A CONDITIONAL: DELIVERY *DID* TRADE, so the census now carries a REAL TEST rather than a hypothetical one** — the `acted 0` reading that was correct every previous day would today be a defect. ⭐ **The units were switched to event-driven for exactly this day, and this is the evening that scores that decision.**
> **(c) 🔴🔴 WED EVENING, BEFORE THU 08:15 — THE CHECK1 GATE. ⛔⛔ NOW MANDATORY, NOT CONTINGENT — (a) SUPPLIED ITS PRECONDITION.** ⛔ Not restated here; it is **§C.5's first row, in full, with both routes, all three branches, and the trade_id-keyed predicate re-measured at HEAD.** ⭐ **Cross-referenced rather than copied (§G3)** — a gate written twice is a gate that gets updated once.
> ⚠️ **AND THE TWO NON-INTERVENTIONS, because on flip day the temptation runs the other way:** a **CNC position still open after 15:17 is CORRECT** (EOD6 never touches CNC) ⇒ ⛔ **no intervention** — ⭐ **and TODAY is the first day that carve-out is LOAD-BEARING rather than theoretical: for the first time there is a real CNC position for it to spare** · and **THU 6-AUG** is when the holdings-blindness bites (**11 positions-only readers, 6 correct BY ACCIDENT, 3 of those on the kill path** — §C.6 F1), which is a **Thursday** fact and must not be pulled forward into Wednesday's decisions. ⭐ **It also stops being a class-level worry tonight: there are now specific CNC positions that WILL move from `positions()` to `holdings()` at T+1.**

⭐ **DATE MOVED BY R2 (Option Y), 02-Aug — a RESEQUENCING, not drift.** 4-Aug is **not
deleted**: it is now the **shakedown day**, and the **flip flags are pushed on Tue 4-Aug
evening** so the flip itself lands **Wed 5-Aug**. The extra day buys **one additional
clean observation day and the first real EOD census** before anything irreversible.

**SOURCE:** S4 line 283–288 · S2 §1 · S3 IA-XCFG-04 · **the date and sequence: A-DEC R2.**
**WHY-PENDING:** gated on A1. **The four flags** (verified consumers, IA-XCFG-04):
`delivery_enabled` · `force_intraday_only` · `capital.conditional_allocation_enabled`
(= **R10**, §C) · `trade_type` (strategy control).
⭐ **RIDING THE SAME FLIP-FLAG PUSH (R4):** the `cnc_gtt_placer` + `cnc_gtt_monitor`
registry edits (expected-dormant → **expected-event-driven**). ⛔ Without them the census
**mismatches by design** on the very day delivery goes live.

**THE HARD GATE — now THREE parts, all settled (R1):**
1. **Monday's observation ran** (A1);
2. **it came back clean** — ⛔ ANY unexplained row postpones it; it is the query's binary
   answer, **not a judgement made at 16:00 on the day**;
3. ✅ **THE THIRD PART IS NOW DECIDED, NOT OPEN — R1: the gate IS 3-part.** **The buy-day
   filter (A4) must be live.** ⛔ **If the filter slips, the ENTIRE flip postpones** — not
   merely the carry pilot. *(A0 closed 02-Aug; see A-DEC.)*
   ⚪ Status: A4 is `<BUILT — NOT DEPLOYED>` across all three sell-under-kill sites and
   rides the **Mon 3-Aug** code push (R2/R3), so on the current plan part 3 is **satisfied
   by Tuesday** — this gate binds only if that push slips.

✅ **CLEARED BY THE AUDIT, recorded so the flip does not re-derive it** (IA-XCFG-04,
§B-below-line): the delivery-flag graph is **coherent, no unguarded combination**; **VM
config == repo config, md5-identical ×3**; the scheduled kills **correctly exempt
delivery** (T2-proven, P7); the GTT construction path is **broker-proven end-to-end**
(T2 5/5).

⚠️ **PREDICTED BY THE AUDIT — will happen, noisy but harmless** (IA-XEVOLVE-04): F1's
three false-alarm faces on every delivery lifecycle event (**IA-P8-04**) · the GTT-blind
"naked" warnings (**IA-P5-06**) · the never-run `delivery_symbols` exclusion branch (G6)
going live.
🔴 **AND WILL NOT BE CAUGHT BY THE FLIP'S OWN INSTRUMENTS:** the `eod_verify`/shadow gate
is **broken** (**IA-P8-01**, §B#6) ⇒ ⛔ **"a clean shadow week" CANNOT certify the
expansion.**

## A3 — THE CARRY PILOT (D1) `<PENDING, BLOCKED>`

**SOURCE:** S2 §1 (*"the flip and the CARRY PILOT must be SEPARATED"*) · S4 §7.9(f).
**WHY-PENDING:** **blocked until A4 ships.** The flip is a non-blocker; the pilot is not.
⚠️ Also blocked by **Q4's HARD_KILL decision** (memory `q4_hard_kill_delivery_30jul`:
*"🔴 Blocks the CARRY PILOT, not the flip"*).

> 🔴🔒 **NEW HARD GATE 03-Aug — `#2e` MUST LAND BEFORE THIS PILOT (Rama's ruling ~10:30).** Record: `docs/audit/ledger2e_design_03aug2026.md` · evidence `docs/audit/kill_drill_03aug2026.md` §4 @ `0c17056`. **THE DEFECT:** under a HARD_KILL the **local-pass** flatten sells the symbol's **net across ALL products** — measured `place_order('SYM','SELL',**15**,…)` on a `(SYM,MIS 10)+(SYM,CNC 5)` book ⇒ **5 shares come out of the delivery position the buy-day filter spared one line earlier.** Root cause `broker/position_helpers.py:34-39` (`broker_net_qty` sums by SYMBOL, no product filter), consumed at `kill_switch.py:1613`; **site 2 (`:1665`) uses the per-row qty and is CORRECT ⇒ the two sites disagree.**
> ⭐ **WHY IT GATES *THIS* ITEM SPECIFICALLY: the pilot exists to HOLD DELIVERY WHILE TRADING INTRADAY — which IS the two-row `(symbol,MIS)+(symbol,CNC)` book. It does not merely make the collision possible, it MANUFACTURES it deliberately and repeatedly.** The CNC half already exists (T2's 5 overnight CNC since 29-Jul); the pilot supplies the missing intraday half by design ⇒ **what is latent today becomes routine the moment the pilot runs.** Same shape as Q4's rule that the filter lands before anything holdings-aware.
> ⛔ **IT DOES NOT GATE WEDNESDAY'S FLIP** — flip and pilot were separated deliberately, and the flip alone does not create the two-row book. ⛔ **AND IT DID NOT BLOCK MONDAY'S PUSH:** the defective helper is byte-identical to what is already live, and the push takes CNC sparing from **0 sites to 2** ⇒ a strict improvement.
> ⛔ **DESIGN ONLY — NOT IMPLEMENTED, NOT AUTHORISED.** `broker_net_qty` is **shared** with `order_placer`'s emergency exit and **FIX-190 created it to PREVENT an oversell** (the 19-Jun THELEELA `BUY 1 → SELL 1 → SELL 1 → short −1`) ⇒ **a careless product filter re-opens that class.** Careful-loop, not a one-liner. Three directions recorded (D-A/D-B/D-C), **none chosen**; Step 1's acceptance criterion is *"can the THELEELA sequence still be detected per-product"*. ⚠️ **Any pin must drive the REAL `determine_close_direction`** — the existing suite stubs it and would be vacuous (practices §V4, 2nd entry). ⛔ No new register row — **231 stands.**

> 🔴 **Case B — SAME-SYMBOL MIXED BOOK: site 1 sells the SYMBOL NET, not the intraday qty.** Local MIS trade `SYM` qty **10**, broker holds `SYM` MIS 10 **and** `SYM` CNC 5 ⇒ measured `place_order(SYM, SELL, **15**, INTRADAY)`. **The 5 extra shares come out of the delivery holding this filter just spared.** Root cause is ONE function: `broker/position_helpers.py:34-39` `broker_net_qty` sums every row matching the **symbol** with **no product filter**, and `kill_switch.py:1613` (site 1) consumes it via `determine_close_direction`. ⭐ **Site 2 is CORRECT by contrast — it uses the per-row `pqty` (`:1665`) and never calls the helper.** ⇒ **the two sites disagree, and only one had been measured.**

(*"Q4/Q7, P7.2(b)"*) · S3 XE.2(f) · S5:103-106.

**THE SPEC, COMPLETE, IN ONE LINE (S2 §3.3):** *restrict flatten + the FIX-181 sweep to
`product in ("MIS","CO")` (from EOD6/FIX-015) · fallback-FLATTEN a NULL product · raise
CRITICAL naming that trade when it does.* ⭐ **The CRITICAL is IN SCOPE of the filter,
not a follow-up** (Q6, Rama 30-Jul 20:30). ✅ **Q9's BL9 trace is DONE (30-Jul)** ⇒ the
filter is the only pre-4-Aug build left.

**WHY IT RANKS #2 IN THE DEBT LEDGER (S3 XE.3):** *"The ONLY item with a hard date and an
ordering constraint that blocks three other workstreams."*

⛔⛔ **THE ORDERING CONSTRAINT — the single most important sequencing rule in the audit
(S3 XE.2(f)):** **the filter MUST land BEFORE anything makes a live component
holdings-aware.** HARD_KILL currently sells a delivery position **on its buy day**, and
the T+1 protection is an **ACCIDENT of holdings-blindness** that any holdings-aware change
destroys. It does **not** bite everywhere — applied term by term in the D-8 design:

| D-8 work | filter-blocked? |
|---|---|
| **step 1** — scope `reconcile_positions` to intraday | ✅ **UNAFFECTED** (it is a RESTRICTION) |
| **steps 2 & 4 · Q1(b) · FORCE_EXIT_ALL · the GTT check** | ⛔ **BLOCKED until the filter lands** |

⚠️ **WINDOW:** *"THE HONEST WINDOW IS THE WEEKEND: Sat 1-Aug / Sun 2-Aug"* (S4:1054).
⛔ **If it does not land, DO NOT RUSH IT MONDAY NIGHT** — it decides a PRODUCT on a live
order ⇒ **careful-loop** (design → review → implement), not an evening patch. **Something
slips instead, and which thing slips is A0.**

### 🔴 SUB-ENTRY ON ROW 7 (H5) — 05-Aug-2026. ⛔ **NOT A NEW ROW. 231 STANDS.**

> ⛔ **ROW 7 IS CURRENTLY THE SOURCE OF A WRONG SEARCH STRING, AND IT COST NOTHING TO FIND
> ONLY BECAUSE THE CHECK WAS RUN THE OTHER WAY ROUND.**
>
> *Placed here rather than inside row 7 because that row is one enormous single-line table
> cell; appending inside it risks breaking the table. Cross-referenced, not relocated.*
> ⚠️ **M3 instance recorded in passing:** this claim was measured at `:763` and sits at
> **`:832`** at HEAD — the item-4 sub-entry shifted it by exactly **+69 lines**.

**Row 7 says** a held delivery position blocks every intraday entry on that symbol *"invisibly,
because it rejects as `DUPLICATE_SYMBOL`"*, and asks: *was any intraday signal on a held CNC
symbol rejected AFTER the CNC fill? If yes, H5 has its FIRST PRODUCTION INSTANCE.*

| the claim | verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| mechanism: `has_active_position` filters **symbol + status only — no product, no date** | ✅ **CORRECT** | **(S)** `state_store.py:839-853`, read verbatim 05-Aug |
| consumed at `risk_engine.py:690` as `DUPLICATE_SYMBOL` | ✅ **CORRECT** | **(S)** |
| a delivery hold blocks intraday on that symbol **for all N days** | ✅ **CORRECT** | **(S)** |
| ⛔ **the code you will see is `DUPLICATE_SYMBOL`** | 🔴 **WRONG FOR THE FILL DAY** — right from day 2 | **(P)** 05-Aug: **6 × `SYMBOL_DIRECTION_DAILY_LIMIT`, 0 × `DUPLICATE_SYMBOL`** |

**Why:** a **second, earlier, also product-blind** gate shadows it. `signal_processor.py:693`
*(deployed `0197923`; `:717` at HEAD — M3)* raises `SYMBOL_DIRECTION_DAILY_LIMIT` **before**
`risk_engine` is ever reached.

> ### 🔴 THEREFORE H5's OWN MECHANISM HAS **NOT** HAD ITS FIRST PRODUCTION INSTANCE. **STILL LATENT.**
> **(P) CONFIRMED:** a **product-blind** gate blocked intraday signals on a symbol a CNC fill had
> claimed — real, observed, six times. **The coupling CLASS is confirmed.**
> 🔴 **(S) NOT H5's MECHANISM:** `has_active_position` was never reached; the pipeline rejected
> upstream. ⛔ **Those two facts must travel together.**

**⚠️ THE RISK ROW 7 CREATED, STATED PLAINLY:** an operator following it greps `DUPLICATE_SYMBOL`,
gets **zero**, and records *"no H5 instance"* — **while a real product-blind block DID happen.**
⭐ **A live instance of `V5`** (a check with no failing input available to it manufactures
confidence) **and of the wide-check rule.** ✅ What saved it: enumerating the actual
`rejection_reason` values instead of searching for the predicted ones.

> ### ⏰ **THE DATED, FALSIFIABLE PREDICTION — THU 06-Aug**
> **(S)** the two gates have **different reset semantics**, both verified 05-Aug:
> `SYMBOL_DIRECTION_DAILY_LIMIT` counts via `SUBSTR(created_at,1,10) = today`
> (`state_store.py:707-725`) ⇒ **resets at midnight**; `has_active_position` keys on
> `status IN ('PENDING_FILL','OPEN','PARTIAL')` with **no date** (`:839-853`) ⇒ **does not reset
> while the position is OPEN.**
> **(I)** ⇒ **IF ATULAUTO IS STILL HELD ON 06-Aug AND ANY INTRADAY SIGNAL ARRIVES ON IT, THE
> REJECTION CODE SWITCHES TO `DUPLICATE_SYMBOL`** — H5's genuine first production instance.
> ⛔ **If no intraday signal arrives, the result is NOT DETERMINABLE — not a refutation.**
> ⛔ **Never observed. This is arithmetic over two verified predicates, not a measurement.**

⛔ **Nothing is fixed here and no fix is implied.** Row 7's ranking, mechanism and multi-day claim
all stand unchanged; **only the expected code name is corrected, and only for day 1.**

**S3 carries 95 finding IDs.** 22 are ranked above. **The remaining 73 are not
unimportant — they are un-*ranked*:** the ledger ranks by change-risk × blast-radius, so a
correct-but-narrow LOW sits below a broad MED. ⛔ **They are cited here by phase, exactly
as G20's ~55 line items are pointed at rather than re-enumerated. `docs/audit/integrity_audit_2026.md`

⭐ **BELOW-THE-LINE ITEMS THAT NEVERTHELESS CARRY A DATE OR A GATE — flagged so the

- **IA-P8-04** · **IA-P5-06** — the noise the flip **will** produce (§A2). *Expect them; they are not findings on the day.*
- **IA-XEVOLVE-04** — the delivery expansion's own assessment: **MED with the filter, HIGH without it.**
- **IA-XEVOLVE-03** — ⛔ the operational rule it yields: *no new code path that can place an order should be exercised on the VM until the fault-injecting fake exists and the crash-test exclusion is explicit.*
- **IA-P10-02** — **v46 (or any schema bump) repeats the 27-Jul refusal night BY CONSTRUCTION.** Binding on every future schema push.
- **IA-XEVOLVE-02** — 📌 **carries R1's deferred-edge note into the verdict verbatim** (§C-R1n).

## §B.3 — 📌 THE VERDICT'S ONE-SENTENCE FRAME (⛔ quote it, do not re-derive it)

> **"The system has no mechanism that verifies a declared thing actually has an effect."**
> ~22 subsystems and knobs are configured, built, often constructed and started — and
> **inert**. They pass every test because **tests construct their own objects and pass the
> arguments production forgot.** This one gap explains **roughly half** of everything the
> campaign found.
>
> **"This system's integrity problem is a truth-telling problem, not a correctness
> problem"** — a far better problem to have, and a far easier one to fix.
>
> **"Worth and powerful, not a toy" — YES, as engineering, with one caveat that must not
> be softened: R1 stands. The system shows NO MEASURABLE PROFITABLE EDGE.** ⇒ *a
> well-built machine that is not yet profitable, whose defects are overwhelmingly of the
> "declared-but-inert" class rather than the "wrong when it runs" class.*

Status moved: **4 real-sector trades now, not 1**. 🔴⭐ **NEW 04-Aug — A SECOND, INDEPENDENT DEFECT IS STACKED ON THIS ONE, AND EITHER FIX ALONE IS INERT: `max_sector_exposure_pct` IS STRUCTURALLY UNREACHABLE — A UNIT MISMATCH.** It measures **MARGIN** (`state_store.py:820` sums `margin_reserved`; gated `risk_engine.py:638` against `max_sector_pct × snap.total`) while the two caps above it measure **NOTIONAL** (`max_concentration_pct` `position_sizer.py:423-424`; `max_position_value_pct` `:137`). **Scale-free proof: 5 positions × 10% notional = 50% of capital notional ⇒ 10% of capital in MARGIN at 5×, against a 40% margin ceiling ⇒ it would need ~20 concurrent positions to bind, FOUR TIMES `max_open_positions: 5`.** ⇒ ⭐ **this independently explains why the 04-Aug census reads `risk.sector_cap_bound: acted 0` and why IA-P3-05 called the soak "structurally eventless" — the cause is a UNIT MISMATCH, not sector diversification** — and ⛔ **flipping `sector_cap_mode: observe → enforce` today would change NOTHING.** ⚠️ **TWO DEFECTS STACKED: G3 (81/82 UNKNOWN inputs) + the unit mismatch (an unreachable threshold).

## §C.5 — DATED / STANDING OPERATOR ITEMS (⏰ these have clocks)

> ⛔ **ACCOUNTING NOTE, 04-Aug — stated rather than left to be discovered:** the two dated entries added at the head of this table (**the Wed-evening CHECK1 gate** and **the Thu 6-Aug holdings-blindness date**) are **OPERATOR GATES, not new register items.** Each is the *clock* on work already counted elsewhere — the CHECK1 gate belongs to **§A2/§A3's delivery lifecycle**, and the Thursday date is **§C.6 `F1`**, which already exists. ⛔ **Neither introduces a new item; 231 stands.** ⭐ They are surfaced here because §C.5 is the only section a reader consults for "what has a clock on it", and a gate that exists only inside a long §B row is a gate nobody reads in time.
> ⛔ **EXTENDED 05-Aug — the note now covers THREE, and the third is stated with its arithmetic because §E's new rule demands it:** the **daily 08:15 token-file check** below is likewise an **OPERATOR GATE, not a new item** — it is the *clock and the mechanism* on the boot that **§A1/§A2 already count**, traced in full at **§A2's BOOT CHAIN block**. ⛔ **231 STANDS; §1's distribution is UNCHANGED because nothing moved between bands** — ⭐ and that is checked, not assumed: §E's rule is that **a MOVE is invisible to a total and fully visible to a distribution**, so the test is "did any item change section?", and the answer is **no**. *(§C stays 104, §E stays 1, `from A` stays 132.)*

## §C.6 — THE 30-JUL FINDINGS STILL OPEN (F1 · F2 · F4 · F5)

| id | item | why-pending | ⭐ audit cross-link |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | `reconcile_positions` is **BLIND to delivery from T+1** — reads `positions()` only, **never `holdings()`** ⇒ ⛔ **a 15:45 SUCCESS is NOT evidence the book is flat**. ⛔⛔ **CORRECTED 04-Aug-2026 (§G4 — added BESIDE, the original NOT rewritten, because the understatement is the point): F1 IS SCOPED AS ONE READER AND IT IS A CLASS OF TWELVE.** AST census at `2d9c114` (⛔ not grep — grep returns 15 because it cannot tell a call from a **docstring mention**): **12 `get_positions()` call sites vs 1 `get_holdings()` call site**, and **exactly one file reads both** (`cnc_gtt_monitor._gather:432`). The audit's *"3× positions()-only readers"* is a **4× undercount**. ⭐ `zerodha_adapter.py:929` defines holdings as *"Carried (**T+1+**) CNC delivery holdings"* ⇒ **a delivery position sits in `positions()` on its buy day and moves to `holdings()` at T+1, so all twelve go blind to it exactly ONE DAY after purchase** — incl. **the HARD_KILL broker sweep** (`kill_switch:1854`), **all three `eod_squareoff` sites**, and **`broker_net_qty`** (`position_helpers:37`, which backs `determine_close_direction` for the kill path *and* order_placer's emergency exit). ⛔ **NOT a claim all twelve are defects** — the kill's blindness is *correct* per Q4 (delivery survives a HARD_KILL) but **correct BY ACCIDENT**, which is why the buy-day product filter must land before anything makes the kill holdings-aware. ~~**Each of the twelve needs its own verdict; none is issued.**~~ ✅✅ **SUPERSEDED 04-Aug (§G4) — THE VERDICTS ARE NOW ISSUED, one per reader, and they do NOT all point the same way.** Of the **11 positions-ONLY** readers (12 `get_positions()` sites minus the one file that also reads `get_holdings()`): **1 WRONG and on the CAPITAL PATH · 1 WRONG and advisory · 3 CORRECT BY CONSTRUCTION · 6 CORRECT BY ACCIDENT — and 3 of those 6 sit on the KILL PATH.** ⛔⛔ **"Correct by accident" is the whole finding and must not be read as "correct": each of the six is right only because delivery has never been held past T+1, and the flip removes exactly that precondition.** ⇒ **the buy-day product filter must land before ANYTHING makes the kill holdings-aware (Q4's ordering rule), because three of the accidental-correct readers ARE the kill path.** ⏰ **THU 6-AUG is when this bites** — Wednesday's first CNC purchase sits in `positions()` on its buy day (all 11 readers see it) and moves to `holdings()` at T+1. Record: `docs/audit/holdings_blind_readers_verdicts_04aug2026.md`. 🔴 **The flip is what makes the class REACHABLE** ⇒ this is now flip-critical, not latent-forever. Record: `docs/audit/ledger7_multiauthority_measurement_04aug2026.md` §1 | **REAL BUT LATENT** — traced 30-Jul: has never fired and **could not have** (only 3 CNC orders ever in the live DB, all FAILED/CANCELLED). ✅ **Re-confirmed 04-Aug 13:05 by read-only broker probe: holdings 0 · GTTs 0 · net positions 0** — T2's 29-Jul basket is fully closed, so **no already-past-T+1 position exists to test this against**. **Gate = the first live delivery trade (§A2/§A3).** ⇒ **Folds into reconciliation step 1** — ⛔ not a separate workstream. ⛔ **Do NOT buy a CNC position to create the test case before the flip:** it is untracked to the reconciler, fires the known-false `Naked untracked position` alert, and adds a variable to the one morning reserved for having none | ⭐ **A THIRD FALSE-ALARM FACE FOUND → IA-P8-04**: a CNC **sell** from holdings sits in `positions()` as a **NEGATIVE** quantity ⇒ **ORPHAN_AT_BROKER (−qty)**, beyond the doc's buy-day ORPHAN and T+1 MISSING. Measured 31-Jul, 5 rows |
| **F2** | `fix-tests-27jul` shipped **3 test failures** — one root cause: `SCRATCH_DIR = data_store/ct_scratch` sits **inside** the guarded dir | **test-only.** Fix = point `CT_SCRATCH_DIR` outside `data_store/`, or grant the opt-in. ⇒ folded into **G12/T2** as an UPDATE | ⚠️⚠️ **STRUCTURAL POINT PRESERVED:** because the regression BASE *must* include `fix-tests-27jul`, **a failure that commit INTRODUCES can never appear in the before/after delta.** → **IA-XTEST-02** (the base-includes-the-fix structural hole) |
| **F4** | **the EOD report gives the operator a WRONG instruction** — *"SOFT_KILL — needs `deploy/resume.sh` before market open"*, **every day** | The 15:15 kill is a **prior-day** kill that **auto-clears at 08:15**; `resume.sh` begins with `systemctl stop`, so run **after** a boot it would **stop live exit management and the 15:17 squareoff**. Third wrong site | **RANKED → §B#9** (IA-P9-01/-02, alert fatigue / false-safety claims). Sibling of **IA-XDOCS-01** (§B#8) |
| **F5** | Zerodha **refuses MIS** on some symbols — a new error class | Handled correctly, no position taken. ⭐ A staged-never-pushed branch `mis-tradability-filter-30jun` (22 tests, `PATHS.md:235`) is exactly this | S3 P1.4 measured its signal-path signature: `PLACEMENT_FAILED` rows carry the broker message **verbatim**; the 400-handler records into the shared `mis_blocklist` (`main.py:2633-2637`) |

## §C.7 — PARKED, EACH WITH ITS TRIGGER (⛔ a queue, not a graveyard)

**SOURCE: S1 §7 — 7 items.** ⭐ **RE-READ THIS LIST ONLY WHEN A TRIGGER FIRES.**

| parked item | its trigger |
|---|---|
| **Slice 2.5 delivery** (carries M-C2 + M-O7) | **DELIVERY IS ENABLED** ⇒ ⭐ **§A2 fires this** |
| **the live-test cert** (LT001–LT103 + GOLD) | a SEPARATE final project across BOTH pipelines — ⛔ never mixed into a deploy |
| **the 6 destructive crash-tests** (unblocked, unrun) | **a real mid-day restart with live state occurs** (G13) |
| **GUI Screen-04 Signals** | the GUI is being touched for another reason |
| **the ₹0.29 SL** | ⛔ **NO TRIGGER — it is a curiosity, not a defect.** S1 §7: *"If nothing ever fires it should be DELETED rather than parked forever — **say so out loud at the next refresh** rather than carrying it a seventh time."* ⇒ ⭐ **SAYING IT OUT LOUD, as instructed: this refresh carries it again with no trigger and no firing. It is the one parked item whose disposition is DELETE-OR-KEEP and it is owed to Rama.** *(⛔ the exact carry-number is NOT asserted — S1 gives the instruction, not a running count, and this file does not invent one.)* |
| **scanner v1/v2 work** | **the entry logic materially changes (post-M-S4)** |
| **the tick→candle feed** | **a live SAFETY dependency on ticks is identified — ⛔ NONE EXISTS TODAY.** ⭐ **IA-P1-06 sharpens this:** dormancy is **UN-ENFORCED** — `order_placer.py:3393` calls `live_feed.subscribe(...)` on the exit-retry path and the candle-persist consumer is armed at every boot |
| ⭐ **#2c-R OPTION 2 — parent-order-id lookup → `cancel_order(variety="co")`** (the *correct* close for a CO position; #2c-R shipped Option 1, refuse-and-escalate, as the permanent safe fix) — ⛔ **a CROSS-REFERENCE, not an 8th S1 item: this is A4's own parked half, counted ONCE in §A4. 231 stands, and S1 §7's original count of 7 is unchanged.** **OWNER: the CO protocol surface — ⛔ NOT the reconciler** (CHECK2 structurally cannot reach a parent id; `kill_switch` can — its open-trades query already joins `orders … leg IN ('ENTRY','CO')` `:1531` and `orders.order_id` IS the broker id). Carries two riders: the §R7 `kill_switch` three-site CO defect (**needs its own card**) and the §R4 CHECK6/FIX-B alert ceiling | **EITHER: CO trading is INTENTIONALLY ENABLED · OR the broker layer provides RELIABLE PARENT-ORDER LOOKUP.** ⛔ Neither is true today (CO doubly dormant) |

## §C.8 — ⭐⭐ THE ENTRIES FINDING — 📌 R1's STANDING NOTE (S1 §8)

> ### ⛔ THE ✅ ON R1 CLOSED A REGISTER LINE. IT DID NOT ANSWER THE PROFITABILITY PROBLEM.

**SOURCE:** S1 §8 · S2 §5.0 · S3 the campaign verdict + IA-XEVOLVE-02.
**WHY-PENDING:** it is the **only item in this register that no amount of engineering
closes.** Three independent lines converge that **the entries buy EXTENSION**:
**statistical** (band inversion — a high score marks an already-extended move) ·
**geometric** (V3 RR gate: median **0.33** R:R against a **2.0** floor) · **arithmetic**
(win rate **~38–39%** against a **~43.5%** breakeven).

**S3's verdict restates it verbatim and refuses to soften it:** *"a well-built machine
that is not yet profitable… The edge question is deferred, not answered, and **no amount
of fixing the findings in this register will answer it** — that is strategy work, not
engineering work."*

⛔ **DO NOT loosen the V3 gate / `rr_floor` to make this look better** (S1 §5-C, standing
refusal): *"the gate is the only INDEPENDENT read on the entries — tuning it to agree
DESTROYS THE MEASUREMENT."*

⭐ **IA-XEVOLVE-02 adds the one thing R1's decided path cannot see:** the config side of
"add a strategy" is **genuinely safe** (a misconfigured strategy fails **LOUD** at boot) —
but the **SOURCE** side is silent: `range_breakout_long`/`_short` are enabled, mapped,
loaded at every boot and have received **ZERO webhook POSTs for 7 weeks**, and nothing
in-system can notice (**IA-P1-01**). ⇒ **a new strategy #17 would load, and might never
trade, with two live precedents.**

## §C.9 — SUB-ITEMS PRESERVED INSIDE THEIR BUNDLES (55)

⛔ **Counted, named in S1 §9, and NOT re-listed here — re-listing them would fork the
register.** They live inside G11(3) · G12(3) · G13(3) · G18(10) · G19(7) · G20(11) ·
G21(7) · G22(2) · G24(3) · G25(6). **S1 §9 is the enumeration; each bundle above points at
it.**

## §C.10 — OPERATOR KNOWLEDGE RESCUED INTO S2 §4 (8 items) — ⛔ lives nowhere else

⛔ **These were rescued out of the Downloads cards; S2 §4 is now their ONLY home.**
`gtt_state` trap (§4.1 — ⛔ live `gtt_state` = 0 rows and that is **CORRECT**; the broker
API is the only authority) · the daily error census + its known-good baseline (§4.2a) ·
the orphaned-reservation query (§4.2b — **EXPECT ZERO ROWS**) · the ASM/GSM/T2T check
(§4.3 — ⛔ **NOT exposed by the Kite API; only Rama can do it**) · the manual-GTT fallback
formula (§4.3) · the GTT lister (§4.3 — ⛔ **Git Bash, never PowerShell**) · the DP-charges
note (§4.3) · the reconciliation-redesign **D-8** step map (S2 §3.3).

# §D — SETTLED / DECIDED / KEPT FOR RECORD (⛔ NOT OPEN WORK)

## §D.1 — ✅ CLOSED THIS PERIOD (31-Jul → 01-Aug)

| item | evidence | source |
|---|---|---|
| **Q6 — `fix-symdir-27jul`** | ✅ **`<DEPLOYED>` 31-Jul 21:44:48 as `297b587`** — verified 3 ways, `load_all` OK. ⛔ **NOT `<VERIFIED LIVE>`: it first EXECUTES at the Mon 3-Aug 08:15 boot** ⇒ that is §A1 | memory `UNPUSHED_PENDING_DEPLOY_LEDGER`, S2 §1 |
| **THE T2 CLOSE** | ✅ **EXECUTED Fri 31-Jul — DDPI PROVEN, 5/5 `EXIT=0`.** The real test (settled demat, not BTST) | memory `t2_arm_result_29jul` / MEMORY.md |
| **F3 — the close-rehearsal gate could not prove what it claimed** | ✅ **RESOLVED IN-LINE 30-Jul**: `main()` returns at `if not args.confirm` **before** `_build_live_adapter()` where `load_all()` lives ⇒ a **direct `load_all()` run** was added ⇒ `CONFIG_LOAD_OK`. ⛔ **Do not reuse the rehearsal alone as evidence about config.** Recorded as case #6 in memory `feedback_verify_rc_not_output` | S2 §3.4 |
| **F6 — the process finding** (a scheduling fact asserted from memory nearly moved an irreversible step) | ✅ **CONTROL ADOPTED, and nothing had to be reverted — the false claim never reached an artifact.** ⛔ **THE CONTROL: any holiday / trading-day / weekday claim affecting SCHEDULING must be verified against the file TEXT — quote the line, or do not make the claim.** ⭐ Root cause = **a COMMENT in a data file read as DATA**, not a data defect. ✅ `nse_holidays_2026.yaml` reconciles to circular NSE/CMTR/71775 **exactly: 15/15 + 4/4** | S2 §3.8, S4 §7.9 |

### 🔄 ARRIVED FROM §A, 05-Aug-2026 EVENING — **A MOVE, NOT A CLOSURE**

| item | why it is discharged | accounting |
|---|---|---|
| **A1 — the Mon 3-Aug observation window** | ✅ **It ran, and the flip proceeded on it.** The window's purpose was to observe a full session before flipping; the flip happened Wed 5-Aug (R2, Option Y) and **entry + exit are now `VERIFIED LIVE`**. There is no residual work. **(P)** — see the 05-Aug consolidation §(c)/(d) | **§A → §D.** `from A`: §A **5 → 4**, §D **22 → 23**. ⛔ **N is UNCHANGED by this move — a move creates nothing.** *(The count moved to 232 for a different reason: A6.)* |

> ⛔ **A2 (the flip) DID NOT MOVE, and the reason is recorded so nobody moves it later on a glance:**
> its entry and exit are verified live, but **`<T+1 CARRY UNVERIFIED>`** — the carry has never
> survived a settlement cycle. ⭐ **Discharging the easy half of an item is how a register loses the
> hard half.** ⛔ **A5 did not move either** — the deploy slot is still open and still unpushed.

## §D.2 — ✅🟪 DECIDED 30-JUL — KEPT FOR RECORD

**R7 — GEMINI WATCHMAN · ✅ CLOSED (decision final).** *Rama, 30-Jul: "Continue using it.
Do not retire it."* 📌 **ONE CAVEAT SURVIVES, as a DO-NOT: ⛔ do not tighten the prompt** —
that was the single option flagged as carrying risk. Nothing else lives on.

**R1 — STRATEGY REVISION · ✅ CLOSED as a REGISTER ITEM.** *Rama, 30-Jul: the existing 15
strategies (12 intraday + 3 delivery) remain as-is; hammer / evening-star / morning-star
scanner improvements and any NEW strategies are BACKLOG.* ⛔⛔ **NOT "the edge is solved" —
📌 its standing note is LIVE and lives at §C.8.**

**R8 — `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_SECONDARY` · 🟪 DECISION DEFERRED, ⛔ NOT CLOSED.** *Rama, 30-Jul:
"Keep as a placeholder / provision for future use. No implementation now."* ⭐ That
**parks** the choice; it does not make it. 📌 **LIVE CAVEAT — carry it wherever R8
appears:** if this channel is **EVER** enabled it **MUST** be decided **together with the
M-A2 8-second send budget.** The budget is **SHARED across channels**, so a 2nd channel
makes the alert ladder **~52 s** and the 8 s deadline would **cut channel 2 off
mid-ladder.** ⛔ **Enabling it without that decision silently breaks the alert path.**

**G14 — S5 second-half · X2 `eod_verify` columns · 🔗 DECIDED PARK, not a TODO.**
Re-measured 30-Jul: `eod_verification` 30 rows, `pnl_variance = 0.0` on **all 30**, zero
nulls, min=max=0.0 — still dead. **Parked because fixing it ARMS a dormant P&L check**,
which is a decision, not neglect. ⛔ Stop reading it as pending work.

## §D.3 — ✅ CLOSED 30-JUL BY THE STALE-REGISTER SWEEP (3) — ⚠️ AND A COUNT CORRECTION

| item | evidence |
|---|---|
| **G5** — no send-side alert audit trail below CRITICAL | `214a878` → cherry-picked `264dd5b`, **`<DEPLOYED>` 30-Jul 19:55:30**; `_audit_send` verified in the **deployed VM tree** and md5-identical to the pushed blob. ⚠️ **FORWARD-ONLY** — historical gaps stay unanswerable. 🏷️ **not `<VERIFIED LIVE>`** |
| **G6** — PB-01 25 → 12 | ✅ **CLOSED, BENIGN — an INPUT fact.** Width **25·12·15·14**; heartbeat `symbols=` **27→12→16→16**; the 12-day was `symbols=12 queued=12 written=12`, **zero skips**. Gate-rejection and capture-truncation both **REFUTED** |
| **G16** — `DEPLOYMENT.md` stale paths | ✅ **CLOSED — ⛔ NO EDIT MADE, AND THAT IS THE CORRECT OUTCOME.** `67850b8` (16-Jul) had already fixed it — **twelve days before the register recorded it open.** ⭐ *Editing a correct file to satisfy a stale register entry would have been the defect* |

> ### ⚠️⚠️ A RECONCILING CORRECTION AGAINST S2 — STATED, NOT SMOOTHED
> **S2 closes G5 · G6 · G16 with evidence in its §3.7 sweep, but its §6 reconciliation's
> `K` list does not deduct them** (K names Q1–Q5, R0, the Q6-NULL decision, the deploy,
> and two corrected numbers — **10 items, none of them G5/G6/G16**). ⇒ **S2's carried
> figure M=131 still contains these 3.** They are placed here in §D, and the reconciliation
> in §1 below accounts for them explicitly. **This is exactly the class of silent drift
> this register exists to catch, and it is a 3-item bookkeeping discrepancy in S2's own
> count — not a lost item: all three are named, with evidence, in S2 §3.6/§3.7.**

## §D.4 — ⛔ STANDING REFUSALS — DO NOT RE-LITIGATE (11, S1 §5, all re-verified 28-Jul)

| | refusal | the one-line reason |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | `require_hmac` → **KEEP FALSE** | Chartink cannot sign HMAC ⇒ every POST 401s ⇒ **ZERO SIGNALS**. *(S3 P1.4: posture verified in code; **0×401 all-time**)* |
| **B** | the **pre-receive hook** → **DO NOT ARM AS-IS** | guard-2 **false-rejects EVERY push** (trailing-newline bug, `deploy/hooks/pre-receive:53-60`) ⇒ **arming = deploy lockout**. Needs a 1-line fix + a `CRON_GUARD_DRYRUN=1` soak. Guard-1 is sound |
| **C** | `rr_floor` / the **V3 gate** → **DO NOT LOWER OR LOOSEN** | it is the only **INDEPENDENT** read on the entries — **tuning it to agree DESTROYS THE MEASUREMENT** *(see §C.8)* |
| **D** | `regime.enabled` → **DO NOT FLIP** | verified `false` at `system_config.yaml:420`; NIFTY token 256265 **UNVERIFIED** in the production instrument cache |
| **E** | the tick feed / **MODE_FULL** → **NOT AS A ONE-LINER, AND NOT MODE_FULL FIRST** | MODE_FULL would **ACTIVATE M-D1's volume corruption** (`volume_traded` is CUMULATIVE and `candle_store.py:63` SUMS it per tick). **M-D1 FIRST, ALWAYS** |
| **F** | `forward_shadow_record.py` → **NEVER RUN MANUALLY** | the only out-of-sample evidence producer; its output **cannot be regenerated**. ⛔ **A gap is a loss; a manufactured day is a CORRUPTION** |
| **G** | `halt.sh` **DOES NOT EXIST** | the only halt is `systemctl stop`, and it stops entries **AND** exit management **AND** the 15:17 squareoff. ⭐ Flat book ⇒ free; open MIS ⇒ expensive; **a CNC position is NEVER a reason to stop** |
| **H** | SSH → **TAILSCALE-ONLY** → ⛔ **DO NOT CLOSE PORT 22** | **the PC-down runbook depends on :22 being open** — it says SSH from the phone, and the phone has been **OFF the tailnet 23+ days**. ⭐ **THE PHONE IS THE BLOCKER.** ORDER: phone proven on the tailnet → repoint the PC → confirm a console way back in → **only then** :22 |
| **I** | **MIS→CNC fallback** → **CLOSED, WILL NOT BE BUILT** | a decision, not a deferral. **ARCHITECTURE SETTLED: INTRADAY = MIS · DELIVERY = CNC/GTT** |
| **J** | **F2 operator soft-kill** → **DROPPED (Rama)** | ⛔ the "cheap CLI" alternative is **not cheap**: the :8080 app has **no reference to the live KillSwitch** ⇒ **a separate process writing the DB row HALTS NOTHING** |
| **K** | security-watcher `activating/auto-restart` → ⛔ **NOT BROKEN, do not "fix"** | it is the designed `RestartSec=60` heartbeat; **nothing reads its ActiveState** |

⛔ **S2 adds no new refusals; it restates these.** ⚠️ **AND THE AUDIT TOUCHED ONE:**
**IA-XSEC-03** found the *"no root keys exist"* hardening **comment is FALSE** (one
cloud-image root key with a forced command exists) **while the exposure it describes is
genuinely CLOSED** (`PermitRootLogin no` **confirmed effective at the running daemon**).
⇒ **a doc correction that REMOVES A TRAP — it does not reopen refusal H.**

## §D.5 — 🏁 THE CAMPAIGN VERDICT AND ITS GATE (new this period)

**S3 §"CAMPAIGN COMPLETE — 16 PHASES"** is the record: P1–P10 + X-ARCH · X-DUP · X-CONFIG ·
X-DOCS · X-TEST · X-SEC · X-EVOLVE. Method held throughout: **findings only**, measured on
the deployed code, every "found nothing" carrying its search width, **4 stale KNOWNs
closed**, **1 root cause corrected**, **2 of its own measurement errors caught and amended
in-session**. *"Nothing was fixed, nothing pushed, no secret printed, no config or
permission touched, and the 3-Aug/4-Aug sequence was never approached."*

⛔⛔ **THE GATE, KEPT FOR RECORD BECAUSE IT BINDS §B:** **the fix campaign is a SEPARATE
effort and is NOT authorised by the audit.** §B is a running order awaiting Rama's

## §D.6 — THIS FILE'S OWN SUPERSESSION MARK (new this period)

`docs/MASTER_PENDING_28-Jul-2026.txt` and `docs/MASTER_PENDING_30-Jul-2026.md` are
**SUPERSEDED as the working register by this file, and RETAINED as the cited authorities.**
⛔ **Neither is deleted, and every §C item names which one it came from.** The 12 delete
verdicts in S2 §7 are **unchanged and still valid** — ⛔ and **`DEPLOY_CALENDAR_28-JUL_TO_04-AUG.txt`
and `MON_03-AUG_OBSERVATION_CARD.txt` still say KEEP.**

# §E — GOVERNANCE (⭐ NEW BAND, 04-Aug-2026) — ⛔ A SEPARATE QUEUE, NOT A PRIORITY TIER
### 🏷️ **`<BUILT — NOT DEPLOYED>` — `6112791`, 04-Aug 23:37 IST.** ⛔ **The band is DOCS: it executes nothing and is `<DEPLOYED>` only when the register itself ships** (§A5's slot, ~~ahead 5~~ **ahead 6**). ⚠️ **And a band cannot be `<VERIFIED LIVE>` at all — there is no production artifact a governance INDEX could produce**, which is itself the honest reason it belongs in a separate queue.

> ## ⛔ WHY THIS BAND EXISTS, AND THE ONE RULE THAT COMES WITH IT
> Governance improvements have been ranked **against implementation defects** — and they are
> not comparable. A records rule and a live money-path defect answer different questions, so
> putting them in one ranking means priority gets swapped **by accident**, not by decision.
> ⛔ **§E IS A SEPARATE QUEUE, NOT A LOWER ONE.** Nothing here is deprioritised by being moved;
> it is removed from a comparison it never belonged in.
>
> ### ⭐⭐ THE PRIORITISATION RULE — write it down, because it has been doing the work unwritten
> > **DEFECTS ARE RANKED BY EXPOSURE AND REACHABILITY, NOT BY EFFORT.**
>
> ✅ **It is already the operative criterion; it has simply never been stated:** H1/H5 lead the
> coupling work **because they are live from the first delivery fill** (reachability), not
> because they are small — H1 is not. **§B#6 was deferred because its first run lands on a
> census day** (timing/exposure), explicitly *not* because it was expensive — the row calls it
> cheap. ⛔ **And twice a "cheap to fix" label did the ranking and was wrong: §B#3 and §B#6 both
> carry a struck *"~2 lines"*.** ⇒ **effort belongs in scheduling, never in ranking.**
>
> ### 🧾 ACCOUNTING — stated explicitly, exactly as for the two §C.5 rows
> ⛔ **MOVING an existing item between bands does NOT create one. 231 STANDS.** ⭐ **And the
> honest count of what moved is ONE: `G17`.** I am **not** manufacturing moves to populate a
> new band — that would be tidiness masquerading as work, and it would corrupt a reconciliation
> that four documents depend on.
>
> | item | from | why it is governance |
> |---|---|---|
> | **G17** — *AB-910 phases 9+10 never produced; the formal slice is unaudited* | §C.3 | It is a **process/records** gap, not a system defect: nothing in production behaves differently because of it. Ranking it beside `G1`'s 95-minute unwatched window was the exact category error this band fixes |
>
> ⚠️ **AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE MOVE: §C was NOT where the governance
> content actually lived.** A sweep of §C.1–§C.10 finds **one** genuinely-governance row. The
> register's governance content has been living in **§A-DEC / §A-DEC-2 / §A-DEC-3**, in
> **§D.4's standing refusals**, and in **`docs/campaign_practices.md`** — none of which was
> ever ranked against defects at all. ⇒ ⭐ **the mixing the band was created to stop was real
> but SMALL; the larger truth is that governance was UNINDEXED rather than mis-ranked.**
> **This band is therefore primarily an INDEX**, and that is the useful thing it does.
>
> ### 📇 THE INDEX — governance content that lives elsewhere and is NOT moved (⛔ pointers, not copies)
> | where | what it owns | ⛔ do not |
> |---|---|---|
> | **§A-DEC** (R1–R5) · **§A-DEC-2** (D1–D7) | Rama's ratified rulings | re-litigate; **§D.4** lists the standing refusals |
> | **§A-DEC-3** | the settled SHAPE: the five annotation axes + separate STATUS · the pipeline-dimension code rule · the missing home for MODIFIERS · the isolation suite born failing · the wind-down requirement · the order | ⛔ treat as authorised work — **it is shape, nothing is designed or built** |
> | **`docs/campaign_practices.md`** | G1–G5 · M1–M5 · V1–V4 · D1–D4 · AR1–AR8, each with its incident | duplicate a rule into this register; **cite it** |
> | **§D.4** | the 11 standing refusals | re-open without new evidence |
> | **§2** (below) | how to keep this file alive; the AR accepted-risk register | ⛔ let an accepted risk exist without a **reopen condition** |
>
> 🔴 **OPEN GOVERNANCE WORK — carried, not scheduled** (⛔ none authorised; all gated behind
> Wednesday's observation): **(a)** annotate the Part A control inventory with the five axes +
> STATUS — ⛔ **EXTEND the existing inventory, do NOT create a second one**, which would be the
> multi-authority defect (§B#7) committed by the very work meant to cure it · **(b)** the
> pipeline-isolation suite, **seeded with H1 and H5 as its first two FAILING tests** (⛔ written
> after the fixes, they pass on day one and prove nothing) · **(c)** a test that fails if any
> **modifier** applies to 100% of trades without an acknowledgement flag — that single test
> would have caught the tier ladder · **(d)** a home in the taxonomy for **modifiers** at all
> (the tier multiplier and `dynamic_by_winrate` are both uninventoried) · **(e)** ⭐ **COMPACT
> `MEMORY.md` — ADDED 05-Aug WITH AN EXPLICIT TRIGGER, BECAUSE A DEFERRAL WITHOUT ONE DECAYS INTO
> A FORGETTING (§D7's rule, applied to my own deferral).** **MEASURED 05-Aug: 21,147 B against a
> 24,414 B read limit = 86%**, and **ZERO lines violate the per-line byte budget** — ⇒ ⭐ **the file
> is long by ACCUMULATION of ~57 genuinely-live invariants, not by any line being bloated, which is
> the budget check working correctly rather than failing.** **THE NAMED SAFE LEVER:** merge the
> **four-line T2 cluster** into one, now that the T2 basket is closed (holdings 0 / GTTs 0 /
> positions 0, re-confirmed 04-Aug) **and superseded by real delivery trading on 05-Aug** —
> ⛔ **preserving its live invariants as a stub, above all *"Kite's web UI NEVER shows a GTT ID"*,
> which was used in tonight's operator card and must not be lost.** 🔴 **THE TRIGGER — both
> conditions, not either: (i) a session NOT on a live-trading hard date, AND (ii) explicitly
> commissioned to do it.** ⛔ **Not tonight. ⛔ Not as a side-effect of anything else.**
> ⭐ **WHY IT WAS REFUSED ON 05-Aug, recorded so the refusal is a DECISION and not an omission:**
> restructuring the artifact every future session depends on — unsupervised, on flip day, under a
> scope lock, with the operator away — is the wrong trade for 3 KB of headroom, and **every
> relocation candidate checked still carried a live DO-NOT**, which is *why* it is in the HOT file.
>
> ### ✅ THE 05-AUG CARRY-FORWARD SWEEP — **RUN, AND THE HONEST RESULT IS THAT FIVE OF SIX WERE ALREADY LANDED. ⛔ NOTHING RE-ADDED.**
> A check of last night's carry-forward list against the file, **before writing anything**, per §G3 (*"checked BEFORE writing, not after"* — the discipline that already saved `7d4ae6b` from duplicating item 2):
> | carry-forward item | found | where |
> |---|---|---|
> | the settled **annotation** (5 axes + separate STATUS; **`ENFORCE + PLACEHOLDER`** the dangerous cell) | ✅ present | **§A-DEC-3 §1** — ⭐ and it **acquired its first real instance today**: `position_sizer.py:596/:609` report the GLOBAL cap while `:585` enforces the effective one (§A2, item (a)) |
> | the **code rule** (consult the pipeline dimension or declare GLOBAL; routing exists at `position_sizer.py:291`) | ✅ present | **§A-DEC-3 §2** — ⭐ **`:291` RE-MEASURED AT HEAD `e64146f` and it HOLDS** (`bucket = "intraday" if intent in _INTRADAY_INTENTS else "positional"`), per §M3 |
> | the **isolation suite** seeded with H1/H5 **failing**, + the **100%-modifier** test | ✅ present | **§A-DEC-3 §4** |
> | 🔴 the **G2 ↔ tier coupling** registered as a dependency on **BOTH** rows, not a note on one | ✅ **CONFIRMED ON BOTH** — this was the one worth re-checking | **§C.1 `G2`** *and* **§C.2 `G18`**, each carrying the full "ships a doubling" statement |
> | the **modifier gap** (taxonomy covers caps, not modifiers; `dynamic_by_winrate` a second, uninventoried) | ✅ present | **§A-DEC-3 §3** + **§E (d)** below |
> | the **`sl_distance_pct` two-units** disclosure (a vocabulary fix that MOVED the ambiguity, not removed it) | ✅ present | **§C.2 `G18`(b)**, with the 10-hit width stated |
> | ⚠️ the **§2(8) deviation** (no `docs/audit/` build record for the four) | ✅ present **and now extended** to today's pass | **§A5** |
>
> ⭐ **THE POINT OF RECORDING A SWEEP THAT FOUND NOTHING MISSING: a "confirm it is registered" instruction is discharged by CHECKING, and the check is only evidence if its result could have been "absent".** One of the seven (**G2 ↔ tier**) was a genuine two-place claim that could have been half-true, and it was not. ⛔ **Re-stating any of the six here would have been the duplication §G3 forbids.**
>
> ### ⛔ THE ONE THING `6112791` LEFT UNDONE — **CLOSED 05-Aug 00:15, and it is arithmetic, not opinion**
> The band's own accounting says *"MOVING an existing item between bands does NOT create one. 231 STANDS"* — **that is correct and it still holds.** ⛔ **But §1's two tables were not updated to SHOW it**, so as committed the register said `G17` was in §E **and** counted it inside §C's 21 G-items. ⭐ **That is not a count error — the TOTAL was right both ways — it is a PLACEMENT error, and this file's whole §1 promise is *"prove nothing vanished", which is a claim about WHERE things are, not only how many.**
> ✅ **CORRECTED IN §1 BELOW:** the distribution gains an **§E** row (**1, from source A**), **§C moves 105 → 104**, the §C group table strikes `G17` from the G-items list (**21 → 20**), and **N = 231 is UNCHANGED on both axes** — column `from A` still totals **132**. ⛔ **No item was added, removed, closed or re-graded to make this balance.**
> ⚠️ **AND THE GENERAL RULE THIS EARNS, because the band will take more items later: CREATING A BAND IS A RECONCILIATION EVENT.** A move is invisible to a total and **fully visible to a distribution** ⇒ **any future move into §E must edit §1's distribution in the SAME commit**, or the register will keep passing its own count check while pointing at the wrong section.

# §1. ⛔ THE RECONCILIATION — PROVE NOTHING VANISHED

**COUNTING UNIT** (same as S1 §9 and S2 §6, deliberately unchanged): *a named, trackable
item as its source names it.* Where a source bundles sub-items under one ID, the bundle
counts as ONE and the sub-items are counted separately **only where the source itself
enumerates them** (S1 §9's 55).

```

### 🔴 **AMENDED 05-Aug-2026 EVENING — N MOVES 231 → 232. ONE NEW ROW, AND IT IS SAID OUT LOUD.**

⛔ **"231 stands" was repeated correctly all day — every finding was a sub-entry. Tonight produced
one thing that is not.** ⭐ **A register that cannot grow is not a register**, so the count was
decided by test rather than by habit.

**THE TEST APPLIED TO EACH CANDIDATE:** *does it have a root cause no existing row owns, and would
fixing it be separate work?* **Sixteen findings were scored. Fifteen failed the test and are
sub-entries. One passed:**

> ### 🆕 **A6 — THE DELIVERY CARRY BREAKS THE DAILY PROCESS LIFECYCLE.** *(source C, band §A)*
> Root cause owned by no existing row: **the system assumes ONE PROCESS PER TRADING DAY, FLAT AT
> EOD.** A carried delivery position falsifies that premise, and three guards that silently depended
> on it fail together. ⛔ **Not a facet of A2 (the flip worked), not of A3 (the carry pilot is not
> started), not of debt-ledger #1 (that is telemetry coverage, not lifecycle).**

**THE TWO CHANGES, AND BOTH AXES BALANCE:**
1. **+1 NEW ROW** — A6, source **C** ⇒ `from C` **4 → 5**, `§A from C` **1 → 2**, **N 231 → 232**.
2. **A1 MOVES §A → §D** (the Mon 3-Aug observation window is discharged — it ran, and the flip
   proceeded on it) ⇒ `§A from A` **5 → 4**, `§D from A` **22 → 23**. ⭐ **A move changes no total**,
   which is why §A still reads 6 while its composition changed.

**COLUMN CHECK, both axes:** `from A` = 4+0+104+23+1 = **132** ✅ · `from B` = **95** ✅ ·
`from C` = 2+1+0+2+0 = **5** ✅ · rows = 6+96+104+25+1 = **232** ✅ · N = 132+95+5 = **232** ✅
⛔ **Nothing was closed, re-graded or dropped to make this reconcile.**

### 🔴 **AMENDED AGAIN 05-Aug-2026 23:4x — N MOVES 232 → 233. ONE MORE ROW: A7.**

⭐ **The same test was applied, not the same habit:** *does it have a root cause no existing row owns,
and would fixing it be separate work?* **Tonight produced eighteen further findings. Seventeen are
sub-entries. One passed.**

> ### 🆕 **A7 — A TRACKED CONFIG FILE THAT PRODUCTION REWRITES DAILY.** *(source **C**, band **§E**)*
> Root cause owned by no existing row: **a file's AUTHORITY and its WRITER disagree.**
> `config/strategy_direction_registry.yaml` is **version-controlled** and **rewritten by a cron job at
> 16:22 Mon-Fri**, so every deploy reverts it and every officer run re-diverges it. ⛔ **Not a facet of
> A6** (lifecycle), **not of debt-ledger #7** (multi-authority *concepts*, not files), **not of #12**
> (that is the ledger's own untracked-ness — ⭐ **this is the mirror image: tracked, and it should
> perhaps not be**).

> #### ⚠️ **PLACEMENT: THE LABEL SAYS `A7`, THE BAND IS `§E`. THAT IS DELIBERATE AND IT HAS PRECEDENT.**
> It was drafted in the 05-Aug consolidation block, which is why it carries an `A`-style label — but
> **it is not live-trading and has no date: nothing reads the file, and what is owed is a GOVERNANCE
> RULING from Rama** *(should a file production rewrites daily be tracked at all?)*.
> ⭐ **`G17` already established label ≠ band in this register**, and §1's own note is explicit that
> **placement errors are a distinct failure from count errors.** ⛔ **The label is NOT renamed — it is
> cited by that name in tonight's commits and in the memory ledger.**

**THE CHANGE, AND BOTH AXES BALANCE:**
1. **+1 NEW ROW** — A7, source **C**, band **§E** ⇒ `from C` **5 → 6**, `§E from C` **0 → 1**,
   `§E TOTAL` **1 → 2**, **N 232 → 233**.
2. ⛔ **NOTHING ELSE MOVED.** No item was closed, re-graded, discharged or re-banded to absorb it.

```
**COLUMN CHECK, both axes — ⭐ stated in full even though only one cell moved, because *silence about
a count is how it rots*:** `from A` = 4+0+104+23+1 = **132** ✅ · `from B` = **95** ✅ ·
`from C` = 2+1+0+2+1 = **6** ✅ · rows = 6+96+104+25+2 = **233** ✅ · N = 132+95+6 = **233** ✅

⚠️ **A2 IS STILL NOT MOVED**, for the same reason as before: the round trip and the clean shutdown are
verified, but **`<T+1 CARRY UNVERIFIED>`**. ⭐ **Thursday is the day that can discharge it — or not.**

⚠️ **A2 IS DELIBERATELY NOT MOVED.** The flip's entry AND exit are now verified live, but
**`<T+1 CARRY UNVERIFIED>`** — it is not discharged and moving it would bank a green that was never
measured. ⭐ **Discharging the easy half of an item is how a register loses the hard half.**

⭐ **THE ONLY CHANGE IS A MOVE, AND IT BALANCES ON BOTH AXES:** `G17` left **§C** and arrived
in **§E**; **`from A` still totals 132** and **N is still 231.** ⛔ **Nothing was added, closed,
re-graded or dropped to make this reconcile** — had the total needed to move, that would have
been the signal that the band was creating items rather than re-filing one. *(§E was created
by `6112791`; this table is the placement half of that commit, made 05-Aug.)*

✅ **RE-CHECKED 05-Aug POST-BOOT — ⛔ THIS TABLE IS UNCHANGED, AND THE CHECK IS RECORDED
BECAUSE "I DIDN'T TOUCH IT" IS NOT THE SAME CLAIM AS "NOTHING MOVED".** The 05-Aug boot pass
added a substantial amount of *content* — the BOOT PASS, the BOOT CHAIN trace, the three
open items, the token-file operator gate — and **not one register item.** Applying §E's own
test (*"did any item change section?"*): **no**. Every addition is a **sub-entry or scope
expansion on a row that already existed** — the boot facts on **§A1/§A2**, the token gate on
**§A2's boot** (surfaced in §C.5 as a clock, exactly as the CHECK1 gate and the Thursday date
were), the sizing prediction and the `:596/:609` mislabel on **§C.1 G8 / §C.2 G18 / §A-DEC-3
§1**, and the composite-verdict lesson on **§A2**. ⇒ **§C stays 104 · §E stays 1 · `from A`
stays 132 · N = 231.** ⛔ **231 STANDS.**

> ⏰ **SUPERSEDED THE SAME DAY, 05-Aug EVENING — and the paragraph above is left standing because
> it was TRUE WHEN WRITTEN.** It records the POST-BOOT morning check, and at that point 231 was
> correct. **The evening produced A6, a root cause no row owned, and N moved to 232.**
> ⭐ **The two are not in conflict: the morning check found no new item because there was none yet.**
> ⛔ **Do not read the morning's "231 STANDS" as the current count — see the amendment above.**

### THE PER-BAND TALLY, ITEM BY ITEM

**§A = 6** *(⭐ AMENDED 05-Aug evening — composition changed, total unchanged)* — A0 the open
decision · ~~A1 Mon observation~~ **→ §D, discharged 05-Aug** · A2 the 4-Aug flip *(⛔ NOT
discharged — `<T+1 CARRY UNVERIFIED>`)* · A3 the carry pilot · A4 the buy-day filter · A5 the
unpushed deploy slot · 🆕 **A6 the delivery-carry lifecycle break (new 05-Aug)**.
⭐ **A4 is debt-ledger #2 and is counted HERE ONLY.**

**§B = 96** — the XE.3 running order (1, src C) + **all 95 findings**: **22 ranked into
the ledger's 12 rows**, **73 below the line and cited by phase in §B.2**. ⛔ **The 12
ledger rows are a RANKING OVER findings, not 12 additional items** — counting them
separately would inflate this register by 11 and is exactly the vanity S1 §9 and S2 §3.7
both warn against. **Ledger row #2 is §A4 and is not counted again.**

~~**§C = 105**~~ ⭐ **§C = 104** *(05-Aug: `G17` moved to §E — see the distribution note above)* —
| group | count |
|---|---|
| G-items still open (G1·G2·G3·G4·G7·G8·G9·G10·G11·G12·G13·G15·~~G17~~·G18·G19·G20·G21·G22·G23·G24·G25) — ⭐ **`G17` struck HERE and live in §E; the row at §C.3 is struck-but-legible (§G4) so an old citation still resolves** | ~~21~~ **20** |
| R-items still open (R2·R3·R4·R5·R6·R9·R10·R11·R12) | **9** |
| PARKED, each with its trigger (§C.7) | **7** |
| the entries finding / R1's standing note (§C.8) | **1** |
| sub-items preserved inside bundles (S1 §9's enumeration, §C.9) | **55** |
| 30-Jul findings still open — F1 · F2 · F4 · F5 (§C.6) | **4** |
| operator knowledge rescued into S2 §4, living nowhere else (§C.10) | **8** |
| **§C TOTAL** | ~~105~~ **104** |
| ⭐ **§E** — `G17`, moved 04-Aug by `6112791`, placed 05-Aug | **1** |
| **§C + §E** | **105** ✅ *(⛔ unchanged — the move is visible, the sum is not)* |

**§D = 24** — Q6 · the T2 close · F3 · F6 (4, closed this period) · R1 · R7 · R8 (3,
decided 30-Jul) · G14 (1, decided park) · **G5 · G6 · G16 (3, the S2 count correction)** ·
the 11 standing refusals (11) · the campaign verdict + its gate (1, src C) · this file's
supersession mark (1, src C) = **4+3+1+3+11+1+1 = 24**.

### ⚠️ HOW MUCH TO TRUST THIS — stated, because a count that looks exact and is not is worse than an honest range

- ⭐ **B = 95 is EXACT and independently re-measurable** — the derivation (105 unique
  strings − 10 named sub-IDs) is given above so anyone can falsify it in one grep.
- ⭐ **C = 6 is EXACT** *(was 4; A6 added 05-Aug evening → 5; **A7 added 05-Aug 23:4x → 6**)* — all
  six are enumerated by name.
- ⭐ **§A, §B's ledger, §C's group totals, §D and §E are EXACT** — every one of the **233** is
  named or points at a source that names it. **§C's 55 sub-items are the one group carried
  by pointer, and S1 §9 enumerates all 55 by ID.**
- ⚠️ **A = 132 is TAKEN FROM S2, NOT RE-DERIVED.** S2 states its M=131 is exact and
  enumerable from its own §2–§5; this file adds F6 and does not recount the 131. ⛔ **The
  guarantee here is that everything S2 carried is still carried and is placed — not that
  S2's own arithmetic was re-audited.**
- ⚠️ **The 19 "new-and-still-live" inside S2's M were never itemised by S2.** This file's
  §A/§C/§D placement **reconstructs** them as: **§A** buy-day filter · Mon observation ·
  4-Aug flip · carry pilot · the §7.9(f) open decision **(5)** · **§D** the T2 close · F3
  **(2)** · **§C** F1 · F2 · F4 · F5 **(4)** + the 8 §4-rescued operator items **(8)** =
  **19 ✅**. Every element is named in S2 §3/§4/§5. **It is a reconstruction, and it is
  labelled as one.**
- ⚠️ **The 3-item S2 discrepancy (G5/G6/G16) is a REAL correction, and it does not change
  N.** They were inside S2's M=131 and are now placed in §D. **Nothing vanished: all three
  are named with evidence.**

### ⛔ DELIBERATELY NOT CARRIED — so absence is a decision, never an oversight

- **S1's X1–X15 corrections and S2's §3.5 number corrections** — they are *corrections to
  claims*, not trackable items; **neither S1 nor S2 counted them as items**, and neither
  does this file. ⛔ **They remain live reading in S1 §6 and S2 §3.5** and several are still
  load-bearing (X4 the `innings` VOID set · X10 the CRLF trap · X11 paper-cannot-exercise ·
  X15 the `PRAGMA user_version` rollback trap).
- **S1's own §9 not-carried list and S2's §6 not-carried list** — still valid, still in the
  repo, ⛔ **not restated here** (restating them would be the fork this file exists to
  avoid).
- **S2 §7's 12 delete verdicts + the 2 KEEPs** — unchanged, still valid, ⛔ not re-derived.
- **The audit's 10 sub-IDs** (IA-P3-06a, IA-P4-01a/b/n, IA-P4-05a/b, IA-P5-10b, IA-P6-07a/b,
  IA-P9-03e) — **preserved inside their parent finding**, exactly as S1 preserves the 55
  bundle sub-items. Counting them again would inflate B by 10.
- **The audit's ~19 open questions** (`OQ-*`) — ⛔ **they are questions the audit refused to
  guess into findings, not pending work.** They live in each phase's `.5` section.
- **G20's ~55 line-level LOW items** — ⛔ **POINTER ONLY** (S6 is the source of record),
  counted as **1** (G20), exactly as S1 §9 counted them.

# §2. HOW TO KEEP THIS FILE ALIVE

1. **This file is the WORKING register; S1 and S2 are the AUTHORITIES.** ⛔ When they
   disagree with this file, **they win** and this file is corrected — not them.
2. ⭐ **When a new edition drops a section, that is SILENT LOSS with no dangling pointer to
   notice.** Diff SECTION HEADINGS *and* content before calling anything a superset.
   *(S1 §11(6), S2 §8(3) — the rule that produced S1 in the first place.)*
3. **Label every item** `<BUILT>` · `<DEPLOYED>` · `<VERIFIED LIVE>` · `<PENDING>` ·
   `<DEFERRED>`. ⛔ **"fixed" is retired. DEPLOYED IS NOT EVIDENCE** — nine things in this
   system were built, looked alive, and had never run.
4. **§A expires fastest.** A0 expires **Monday's close**. A1 expires Monday night. A2/A3
   expire Tuesday. **§A5 expires at the next real deploy.**
5. ⛔ **§B is a running order, not a task list.** It changes state only when Rama
   commissions the fix campaign — **and then A4 goes first, before anything holdings-aware.**
6. **The same-carrier rule (S1 §11(1)):** any correction reaching `docs/audit/` must also
   reach **this register + the memory palace + SYSTEM_MAP/PATHS**.
7. ⛔ **A file is only deletable once you have named where each of its unique items now
   lives.** This file names S1 and S2 on every item it took from them — **which is exactly
   why neither may be deleted.**
8. ⭐⭐ **THE DOCUMENTATION RULE (adopted 02-Aug-2026).** Record **immediately**, in the
   appropriate permanent place, every **design completion · architectural decision ·
   REJECTED option and why · sequencing decision · governance ruling**:
   - changes **execution order, deploy gating, or priority** → **THIS FILE** (the
     operational **index**), preserving authoritative source references;
   - **implementation-specific** (build notes, verification evidence, regression results,
     commit SHAs) → the **`docs/audit/` build record**, **cross-linked from here**.
   **This file stays the INDEX; `docs/audit/` records stay the EVIDENCE.**
   ⛔ **CALIBRATION GUARD — the rule must not defeat the discipline it serves: it does NOT
   license new register rows.** The reconciled count (**232** since 05-Aug evening; **231** when
   this guard was written) stands; record within existing rows, sub-entries and cross-references,
   exactly as #2b/#2c/#2c-R/#8/#8b did. ⭐ **The guard forbids rows created for EMPHASIS — it has
   never forbidden a row with a root cause no existing row owns, which is the A6 test.**
   Byte budgets still apply. ⛔ **If the rule and the count ever conflict, REPORT it — do
   not resolve it silently.**
   **Why:** rules this campaign earned were living only in chat transcripts and one-time
   cards. A rule that isn't written down gets rediscovered the expensive way — **the same
   truth-telling failure the audit indicts, applied to our own process.**
9. ⭐ **THE STANDING PRACTICES NOW HAVE ONE DURABLE HOME: `docs/campaign_practices.md`** —
   governance (**G1 an auto-filled prompt is never an instruction and never an approval** ·
   G2 ChatGPT is advisory on Rama's decisions · G3 disclose-don't-expand · G4
   superseded-but-legible) · measurement (M1 repo-wide-never-file-wide · M2 prove-don't-
   assert) · validation (V1 paper cannot validate product semantics · V2 the regression
   invocation · V3 the worktree-base mitigation · V4 composition-truth) · deploy (**D1
   there is no partial deploy** · D2 the SHA inventory gate · D3 no push before 18:15 ·
   D4 label honesty). Each rule is recorded **with the incident that earned it**.
   ⛔ It is **process** practice — distinct from `docs/foundation_engineering_rules.md` and
   `docs/trading_system_project_specific_rules.md`, which are **product** engineering
   rules. Do not merge them.
   ⭐ **It also carries §R — THE ACCEPTED-RISKS REGISTER (AR1-AR7)**, each entry naming
   *what was accepted · the reasoning · who accepted it · the date · **the condition that
   would REOPEN it***. **An accepted risk nobody can find later quietly becomes an
   UNACCEPTED one** — rediscovered as a fresh defect, then either re-litigated or "fixed"
   in passing (which G3 forbids). ⛔ **An entry with no reopen condition is not an accepted
   risk; it is an abandoned one.** Seeded from the acceptances already made: **AR1** the
   GATE-Q3 tradeless-day MISMATCH (Rama accepted all 7 gate recommendations, 01-Aug) ·
   **AR2** the q9 oscillator / isolation-only flake · **AR3** the T3 `test_fix181` standing
   failure · **AR4** CHECK6's capital-release-while-live (reopens at the first real
   HARD_KILL) · **AR5** CO dormancy · **AR6** the label ceilings (⛔ reopen only by the real
   event, **never by re-labelling**) · **AR7** #2c-R's Option 2 — **cross-referenced to
   §C.7, not duplicated.**
   ⛔ The trigger list at item 8 also covers **review conclusions (incl. "nothing to
   change") · deployment decisions (incl. a decision NOT to deploy) · implementation
   completions · risk acceptances.**

**END — 01-Aug-2026 (Saturday, market closed), IST.**
Consolidation only. **Nothing deployed, nothing started, nothing decided, no finding
re-derived, and the 3-Aug / 4-Aug live sequence untouched.**
~~⛔ **Committed locally; NOT pushed** — it rides the same future deploy slot as the 21
unpushed audit commits (§A5).~~
⭐ **SUPERSEDED 05-Aug-2026 00:15 IST (§G4).** Those 21 **shipped 04-Aug 19:08** inside the
27-commit push `4149263..0197923`. ⛔ **Still committed locally and NOT pushed** — but the slot
it rides is the **new** one: `main` is **ahead 5** of `origin/main` (`0197923`), and the four
04-Aug-night commits + this pass sit in it. **§A5 holds the per-commit D1 test and the
corrected first-execution dates.**
⛔ **The 05-Aug MORNING currency pass changed STATUS, SHAs, PLACEMENT and one refuted timing
premise. It created NO register row, closed nothing, and re-derived no finding — N = 231 stands.**
⏰ **The 05-Aug EVENING pass DID create one (A6) and discharged one (A1 → §D): N = 232.** ⭐ Both
sentences are true of their own pass; the count in this line is the morning's.

# ✅ 26-AUG-2026 — **FORMAL CLOSURES (A5).** ⛔ N UNCHANGED — no new row, no row retired.

> ⚠️ **READ THIS FIRST — WHY THESE ITEMS APPEAR HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME.** The `F-`, `Q-`, `O-` and
> `DEFECT` series were tracked in `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md`, in the unpushed-deploy ledger and in
> `mempalace.yaml` — **none of which are on `origin/main`**. 🔬 Measured 26-Aug: this register
> contained **zero** occurrences of `F7`, `F8`, `Q-3`, `Q-4`, `DEFECT D`, `O-1`, `O-2` and
> `DEFECT B`. ⇒ ⭐ These are therefore **RECORDED, not flipped** — ⛔ nothing here retires a status
> this file previously held, because it held none.

| item | status | one-line reason | measurement source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F7** | **CLOSED · NO FIX** | CHECK 1 = `L\B`, CHECK 2 = `B\L` — complementary halves of `L△B`. The *"algebraically the same"* premise is **REFUTED**. | `orders/order_reconciler.py` — CHECK 1 `_check1_manual_close`, CHECK 2 `_check2_orphan_adoption` |
| **F8** | **CLOSED · NO FIX** | CHECK 2 is `_log.info` at `order_reconciler.py:1834`, with **21 production lines** present. The DEBUG→INFO premise is **REFUTED**. | source line + production log count |
| **Q-3** | **CLOSED** | `:4038` opens the call; `:4051-4053` is the kwarg **inside** it. ⭐ The defect was the **METHOD** — line arithmetic across a multi-line call. | `main.py` read end-to-end across the call |
| **Q-4** | **CLOSED** | `trades.exit_time` is **IST with an explicit `+05:30`**, written by `_now_ist_iso()`. The UTC premise is **REFUTED**. | stored values + the writer function |
| **DEFECT D** | **CLOSED** | Its premise depended on Q-4, which is refuted. ⚠️ **SURVIVING LATENT FINDING, recorded:** `DATE()` converts to UTC while `substr(...,1,10)` does not; they disagree **only below 05:30 IST**, and **0 rows** fall there. 🏷️ **LATENT, ⛔ NOT LIVE.** | row scan of the boundary window |
| **O-2** | **CLOSED** | `MEMORY.md` is **8,877 B = 37%** of its 24,000 B guard. The ~25.5 KB truncation premise is **STALE**. | `wc -c` on the index |
| **O-1** | **CLOSED · RATIFIED AS-IS** | Verified against source (M5); **no difference found**; the L-3 posture is confirmed. ⛔ **Do not reopen P-3.** | source-vs-record comparison |

⭐ **The closures are recorded with their reason and their source so that a later reader can
re-run the measurement rather than trust the verdict.**

# 🔬 26-AUG-2026 — **TODAY'S FINDINGS, AT THEIR MEASURED LABEL (A6).** ⛔ NO LABEL UPGRADED. ⛔ N UNCHANGED.

| finding | 🏷️ LABEL — ⛔ as measured, ⛔ not improved |
|---|---|
| **DEFECT B** — CNC exit prices sit far from their triggers | **BEHAVIOURALLY ESTABLISHED AT POPULATION SCALE · MECHANISM UNRESOLVED · ⭐ PARKED AS NON-CORE.** ⛔ Do not reopen. ⚠️ Returns to scope **only** if shown to affect sizing, reservation, execution, risk or lifecycle. ⭐ **The broker is the final truth; a reporting discrepancy does not change what was traded.** |
| **A-1** — the like-for-like control | **CLOSED.** MIS `SL_HIT` **n=137** · exact **15 (11%)** · min 0.000 · p25 0.026 · **med 0.1404** · p75 0.358 · max 2.672. MIS `TGT_HIT` **n=90** · exact **49 (54%)** · min 0.000 · p25 0.002 · **med 0.0043** · p75 0.019 · max 9.622. ⚠️ **`n=138` / med 0.1459 SUPERSEDED — a RAMCOIND join fan-out.** ⛔ The *"ratio < 2"* ambiguity rule is **WITHDRAWN** (threshold taken from the data it was applied to). ✅ S-4's five-treatment robustness **RETAINED**. |
| **CHECK 1** exclusion of CNC trades | **PROVEN DESIGN PROPERTY** — the ACTIVE-GTT ownership boundary, `orders/order_reconciler.py:876-877`. ⛔ **Not a bug.** |
| **PHANTOM** capital over-reservation | **MEASURED WINDOW ≈ 11 m 51.8 s** (start = the **first observed** `broker_used` collapse; ⚠️ ⛔ the true broker close time was **NOT directly measured**). ⭐ Acceptability is a **DESIGN DECISION**, ⛔ not a defect verdict. |
| **CAUSE 3** | residual **435.19** vs position **454.48** at `carry = 0` ⇒ **CONTROLLED BENIGN REFERENCE CASE.** ⛔ **NOT a revert condition.** |
| **THE EXIT-PRICE CONTRACT** | **ABSENT / UNSPECIFIED.** 🔬 `orders.avg_fill_price` is **NULL on all 1,205 orders**; `orders.price` is populated on **591 / 1,205**. |
| **ERRORS OWNED** | 🔴 **THIRTEEN, unsoftened.** ⚠️ **#11 and #12 are the SAME SHAPE — a join fan-out, hours apart** (`trades ⋈ gtt_state`, then `trades ⋈ orders`). ⭐ **The PATTERN is the finding, not the instances.** ⚠️ **#13 (this evening): I recorded a CNC position as "invisible to a broker-positions filter" when it is DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE — `get_open_intraday_positions()`, EOD6 design. I reached for the interesting explanation before the simplest one.** ⚠️ *(A6 as issued said TWELVE; #13 was found after that file was written.)* |
| **THE CARRY TEST** | **NOT EXERCISED — DESIGN PRESERVED INTACT:** OWED-2 · carry CHECK 1 · CHECK 2a · CHECK 2b · the four-reading series · the three-cause discriminator · G3 settled-CNC T+1 · F6-leg T+1 · the `A_sameday` baseline. ⭐ **TRIGGER: the next trading day that ends with a DELIVERY/CNC position open *at the broker* at 15:30.** ⭐ A standing **WATCH ITEM**, ⛔ not a scheduled task. |
| **PARKED OBSERVATION** | Four `gtt_state` rows still `TRIGGERED` from 05–11 Aug (ATULAUTO ×2, DIFFNKG ×2). **Both trades are CLOSED**, so the `:876-877` exclusion is harmless. ⭐ Observation only, ⛔ no branch opened. |

## ⛔ A3 — **CANNOT COMPUTE, AND SAID SO RATHER THAN SKIPPED**
`N20-20` asks for the register row **`N20-14`** to have its markdown column count corrected
(reported as 5 structural pipes vs 3, pre-existing at `b019540`).
🔬 **MEASURED: that row does not exist.** `N20-14` appears in exactly three places — `SYSTEM_MAP.md`,
`drift_comparator_fix_20aug.md` and the unpushed-deploy ledger — and **all three are prose
descriptions of the defect**; the `SYSTEM_MAP` line contains **0 pipe characters**. This register
contains **zero** `N20-` entries. ⇒ ⛔ **A column count cannot be corrected in a row that is not there.**
⭐ **Left OPEN and reported.** ⛔ Not invented, ⛔ not silently dropped.
