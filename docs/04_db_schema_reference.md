⛔⛔ **CORRECTED 04-Aug-2026 AGAINST THE LIVE DB — the previous description was wrong in
three ways, and one of them actively caused a false finding.** Struck rather than deleted
(§G4), because *what* it said is the reason the rule below exists:

- ~~`id INTEGER PK`~~ → the PK is **`ledger_id`**; ~~`timestamp`~~ → the column is **`ts`**.
- ~~`entry_type … RESERVE/RELEASE/PNL/COST/ADJUSTMENT`~~ → **`PNL`, `COST` and `ADJUSTMENT`
  DO NOT EXIST.** Measured vocabulary, all-time: **`RESERVE` · `RELEASE` · `RELEASE_USED` ·
  `COMMIT` · `INIT` · `SYNC` · `RESET_PNL` · `TOP_UP`**.
- ⛔ ~~`reservation_id -- Links RESERVE ↔ RELEASE`~~ → **THIS IS THE TRAP.** See below.

```
ledger_id INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT
ts TEXT NOT NULL
entry_type TEXT NOT NULL   -- RESERVE | RELEASE | RELEASE_USED | COMMIT
                           -- INIT | SYNC | RESET_PNL | TOP_UP
amount REAL NOT NULL
bucket TEXT                -- intraday | positional
balance_before REAL
balance_after REAL
signal_id TEXT
reservation_id TEXT        -- ⛔ NOT a simple RESERVE↔RELEASE pair — read below
reason TEXT
session_id TEXT
direction TEXT
trade_id TEXT
margin_delta REAL
pnl_delta REAL             -- the daily-loss limit reads THIS, not trades.net_pnl
costs REAL
```

#### ⛔⛔ A RESERVATION HAS **TWO** TERMINATION SHAPES, NOT ONE

| the trade | its ledger chain | does the terminator carry `reservation_id`? |
|---|---|---|
| **cancelled / rejected** (never filled) | `RESERVE` → **`RELEASE`** | ✅ yes |
| **filled** | `RESERVE` → **`COMMIT`** → `RELEASE_USED` | ✅ COMMIT yes · ⛔ **`RELEASE_USED` NO — 0 of 211** |

⭐ **`release_used()`'s signature takes no `reservation_id` at all** (it keys on
`symbol` + `trade_id`). ⇒ **a query for "RESERVE with no RELEASE" marks EVERY FILLED TRADE as
un-released.** Measured 04-Aug-2026: that query returns **221**; the correct one — *RESERVE
with neither `RELEASE` nor `COMMIT`* — returns **10**, which reconciles exactly with the
independent arithmetic `1327 − 1106 − 211 = 10`. **Two methods agreeing is what makes the 10
trustworthy; the 221 was a false finding produced by the old comment above.**

> ### 🔴🔴 HARD ORDERING CONSTRAINT — **`reservation_id` on `RELEASE_USED` MUST land BEFORE any change that queries CLOSED reservations** *(06-Aug-2026)*
> **Phase E's deferred orphan detection — *"rids in ledger but not in `fm._reservations`"*
> (`order_reconciler.py`, `_check7` docstring) — is exactly such a change.**
>
> **(P) MEASURED 06-Aug:** a **fully released** reservation reports its **entire margin as still
> held** — `sum_fm_ledger_margin_delta('54672bb96d30421d')` → **689.41341**, because the offsetting
> `RELEASE_USED` row carries no `reservation_id` *(0 of 220; `RELEASE` carries it 1189 of 1189 —
> **the keys are perfectly disjoint**)*.
>
> #### 🔺 **RE-MEASURED 07-Aug-2026 10:3x — THE ENTRY IS WORSE THAN `reservation_id` ALONE**
> **(P)** live DB, `SELECT count(*), sum(reservation_id IS NOT NULL), sum(trade_id IS NOT NULL)
> FROM fm_ledger WHERE entry_type='RELEASE_USED'` → **224 · 0 · 65.**
> ⇒ 🔴🔴 **159 of 224 rows (71 %) carry NEITHER key** — ⛔ **not "missing `reservation_id`": missing
> *any* structured identifier**, leaving the **free-text `reason`** as the only handle. ⚠️ That
> inverts the standing rule *never classify by free text when a structured status exists* — **here
> one does not exist**, which is the defect rather than the workaround.
> ⛔ **CORRECTION TO THE 07-Aug CARD, NOT SMOOTHED:** it recorded *"today's row has neither."*
> **Measured, it has one.** Both of today's `RELEASE_USED` rows — **ATULAUTO `ledger_id 10239`
> @08:15:41** *(−587.40, the phantom's release)* and **COSMOFIRST `10277`** @10:13:57 — **carry a
> `trade_id` and lack only `reservation_id`.** The card's counts *(223 · 0 · 64)* were correct when
> taken ~09:36; COSMOFIRST's exit added exactly one to both totals. **The "neither" half is what is
> wrong, and it matters** — it is the difference between *one broken join* and *no join at all*.
> ⭐ **The lifecycle's two halves are keyed disjointly END TO END:** `RESERVE`/`COMMIT` carry
> `reservation_id` *(ATULAUTO's chain: `ee9af41eae554c35`, `RESERVE` 616.79394 → `COMMIT` 587.40)*;
> the terminating `RELEASE_USED` carries `trade_id`. ⇒ **a reservation cannot be followed to its own
> release by any single key**, which is exactly the ordering constraint above, restated from the
> other end.
> **(S)** `_check7` publishes with `source_module="fund_manager_self_check"`
> (`order_reconciler.py:3782`), which **IS** in `_ESCALATING_SOURCES` (`drift_handler.py:66-70`)
> ⇒ **DH1 does NOT bar it** ⇒ **single-sample SOFT/HARD escalation.**
>
> ⇒ ⛔ **Shipping Phase E before this fix would arm a spurious kill on every closed delivery
> reservation.** ⭐ Today `_check7` iterates live reservations only, so the false positive is
> unreachable — **that is the only thing holding it, and Phase E removes it.**

#### 🔴 THE LEDGER IS **NOT SELF-CONSISTENT** — the rule for anyone reconstructing capital

> **Capital reconstructed from `fm_ledger` MUST be reconciled against trade status, or must
> exclude reservations belonging to terminal trades. The ledger alone is not
> self-consistent: 10 reservations (₹1,628.13, dated 15–18 Jun 2026) have NO terminating row
> and never will.**

- **Why they will never be terminated:** the cause is **permanently unknowable** — the
  15–18 Jun window predates all retained logs (`system_*.log` begins 06-Jul). ⛔ **They are
  deliberately NOT reconciled.** Writing terminating rows would assert a termination that
  cannot be proven, and *a wrong correction is indistinguishable from correct data
  afterwards* — the same ruling that kept the 141 fabricated `innings` rows **VOID and
  KEPT**, never deleted.
- ✅ **They do NOT affect live capital.** `fund_manager.rehydrate_from_open_trades` walks
  **OPEN/PARTIAL** trades only, so reservations on terminal trades are never replayed and
  the in-memory state has never held them.
- ⚠️ **Which is exactly why this is a trap and not a bug:** ₹1,628.13 on a ~₹9,871 book is
  **16.5% of capital**. A tool that silently inherited it **would not look obviously
  broken** — it would just be wrong by a sixth.
- ⛔⛔ **BUT READ THAT 16.5% WITH ITS DENOMINATOR, AND PREFER THE OTHER TWO (added 04-Aug-2026).**
  **16.5% is measured against TODAY'S CAPITAL, which is a TESTING value, not the design
  capital** — so that figure **shrinks as the account grows and will quietly stop sounding
  alarming** while the defect is entirely unchanged. **It is the least durable way to state
  this.** The scale-free measurements, each with its denominator named:

  | figure | value | denominator |
  |---|---|---|
  | by **count** | **10 / 1,327 = 0.75%** | every reservation ever opened |
  | by **value** | **₹1,628.13 / ₹133,274.95 = 1.22%** | every rupee ever reserved |
  | ~~by capital~~ | ~~16.5%~~ | ⚠️ *today's ₹9,882.30 — a test value; kept because it is what makes the TOOLING risk vivid, ⛔ not because it is the durable number* |

  ⭐ **The three do not disagree — they answer different questions, and that is the point.**
  **0.75% / 1.22% say how much of the LEDGER is affected** (small, and it does not grow).
  **16.5% says how badly ONE TOOL would be wrong TODAY if it reconstructed capital from the
  ledger alone** (a sixth). ⇒ **quote the count/value ratios when describing the DATA; quote
  the capital ratio only when describing the CONSEQUENCE, and say which capital.**
  ⛔ **Never write a bare "16.5%" without its denominator** — a reader who meets it later will
  reasonably assume it means 16.5% of the ledger, which is off by ~13×.
- ⭐ **And note what protects you: `rehydrate` keys on TRADE STATUS, not on ledger
  completeness.** Re-key any reconstruction on the ledger "for accuracy" and you inherit all
  ten immediately. Record: `docs/audit/reservation_nonatomicity_latent_or_live_04aug2026.md`.
