# Trading System v2 — Operations Runbook

Date: 05-Jun-2026 | Crash Test Day 0 (offline pre-tests)
VM: 161.118.187.249 | User: ubuntu | System: ~/systems/trading-system

## 1. Daily Startup

1. Token generation (manual browser step): Login to Kite web, generate token
2. token-watcher auto-start verification: `sudo systemctl status trading-system`
3. Health check: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
4. Verify no stale kill switch: `python3 tests/crash_test/state_inspector.py --live | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('Kill:', d['kill_switch']['state'])"`
5. Verify capital correct: Check state_inspector output for capital available
6. Verify cron active: `crontab -l | wc -l` (expect 20+ lines)

**Verified by crash test**: PARTIAL — CT093 (graceful shutdown), CT096 (crash recovery), CT100 (cold start) all verified startup scenarios.

## 2. Daily Monitoring

- AGY watchman: Check Telegram for alerts (mode-prefixed)
- Log files: ~/systems/trading-system/logs/ (one file per day)
- Expected signal volume: ~500-2000 signals/day (most rejected by score)
- Health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5000/health` -> status "ok"
- Queue depth: Should be 0/300 outside active processing
- Kill switch: Should be INACTIVE during market hours

**Verified by crash test**: YES — resource_monitor shows real metrics (cpu/ram/disk), state_inspector shows live system state.

## 3. Graceful Shutdown

1. `sudo systemctl stop trading-system`
2. Verify: SHUTDOWN event in logs (`grep SHUTDOWN logs/trading_*.log | tail -1`)
3. Verify: No orphan orders at broker (manual Kite check)

**Verified by crash test**: YES — CT093 confirmed clean shutdown with SHUTDOWN event logged.

## 4. Emergency Shutdown

- **SOFT**: `sudo systemctl stop trading-system`
- **HARD**: `sudo kill -9 $(pgrep -f main.py)`
- **NUCLEAR**: kill + login to Kite web + manually cancel all orders

**Verified by crash test**: YES — CT093 (SOFT), CT096 (HARD). Nuclear requires manual broker access.

## 5. Kill Switch Recovery

1. Check: `python scripts/clear_kill_switch.py --dry-run` (reports state, changes nothing)
2. **A previous-day kill needs none of this** — it auto-clears at the next 08:15 startup
   (`clear_stale_state`). Only a **same-day** kill needs clearing.
3. If SOFT_KILL: fix the root cause, then **LIVE/VM** `sudo bash deploy/resume.sh` ·
   **PAPER/PC** `python scripts/clear_kill_switch.py`
4. If HARD_KILL: verify capital + positions, **confirm the root cause is handled** (an
   emergency kill re-trips if it is not), then `sudo bash deploy/resume.sh --force`
   (PC: `python scripts/clear_kill_switch.py --force`)
5. Post-resume: Inject test signal -> verify processing

> ⛔ ~~**SUPERSEDED 02-Aug-2026 (ledger #8 / IA-XDOCS-01)** — steps 2-3 previously said
> "clear via DB: `sqlite3 … "UPDATE kill_switch_state SET state='INACTIVE',
> reason='manual_clear', triggered_at=datetime('now'), triggered_by='operator' WHERE
> id=1"` -> restart".~~ A raw `UPDATE` writes no `system_events` audit trail, **bypasses
> the HARD_KILL `--force` gate**, and has **no effect on a running service** (`is_active()`
> reads in-memory state). ⛔ And restarting while a kill is still persisted returns
> **exit 4**, which `RestartPreventExitStatus=3 4` makes permanent — the service will not
> come back. Use `deploy/resume.sh`.

**Verified by crash test**: YES — CT007 (kill switch edges), multiple scenarios required kill switch clearing.

## 6. Token Refresh

1. Login to Kite web -> generate token
2. Place token file at: data_store/session/zerodha_token.json
3. token-watcher auto-detects and starts system
4. Verify: health check passes

**Verified by crash test**: NO — requires live Zerodha API.

## 7. Broker Reconciliation (manual)

1. Login to Kite web -> check positions
2. Compare with: `python3 tests/crash_test/state_inspector.py --live`
3. If mismatch: investigate orders table vs broker
4. If position exists at broker but not system: **CRITICAL** — manual intervention required

**Verified by crash test**: NO — requires live broker API.

## 8. EOD Verification

1. After 17:00: Check reports/daily/ for today's report
2. Check Telegram for EOD summary
3. Check: All positions closed (no overnight for INTRADAY)
4. Verify: `python3 tests/crash_test/exactly_once_verifier.py --date today`

**Verified by crash test**: PARTIAL — exactly_once_verifier confirmed working. EOD report generation requires live data.

## 9. Disaster Recovery

1. DB backup: `cp data_store/trading_system.db data_store/backups/trading_system_manual_$(date +%F).db`
2. Full restore: stop system -> copy backup -> start system
3. Config restore: `cp -r config_backup/ config/`
4. Verify after restore: `python3 tests/crash_test/invariant_checker.py --full`

**Verified by crash test**: PARTIAL — CT117 (WAL recovery), CT118 (table drop recovery). Full restore drill not run today.

### 9a. Code rollback — TEMPORARY vs DURABLE  *(added 26-Aug-2026, Q-2)*

The deploy hook checks out the **branch** (`main`), never the pushed revision. That single fact
decides the semantics below. **This section deliberately names no commit SHA — read the current
target from the rollback record in `docs/audit/`, and re-derive it; never paste one from memory.**

1. **A VM working-tree rollback is TEMPORARY.** Checking the deployed tree back to an earlier
   revision is undone by **the next push of anything to `main`** — including an unrelated,
   innocent push by someone who does not know a rollback is in effect. It does not survive.
2. **The DURABLE form is a ref-level change**: a revert **commit pushed to `main`** (the RB-2
   shape in the rollback record), **not** `checkout -f`. Only a change to the ref itself
   survives the next deploy.
3. **POST-ROLLBACK VERIFICATION IS MANDATORY, AND IT IS TWO CHECKS — NOT ONE:**
   - a. the bare repo's `refs/heads/main` matches the intended tree, **then**
   - b. the deployed working tree matches it.
   Checking only (b) passes while the ref still points elsewhere, and the next push silently
   reverts your rollback. Checking only (a) passes while the box still runs the old tree.
4. **A tree-only rollback is a STOPGAP, and it opens a PUSH FREEZE.** From the moment a
   `checkout -f` rollback is in effect until it is made durable per (2), **nobody pushes to
   `main`**. Announce the freeze; lift it only after (3) passes.

> **Why this matters operationally:** a tree-only rollback plus any later push returns the box to
> the broken code with no alarm, no log line, and no one intending it.

## 10. Cron Verification

1. Check: `crontab -l` (expected: 20+ entries)
2. Check: system_events table for cron heartbeats
3. If missing: Check cron logs (`grep CRON /var/log/syslog`)

**Verified by crash test**: PARTIAL — CT130 scenario exists but time-dependent.

## 11. Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Service **`failed`** and stays down — exit 4, **NOT a restart loop** (`RestartPreventExitStatus=3 4`; journal: `Failed with result 'exit-code'`) | A **SAME-DAY EMERGENCY kill of ANY kind** — drift, token expiry, live-feed, API auto-trip, fund-manager, reconciler, System Manager EOD (only the 15:15 breaker and EOD squareoff are "scheduled"). ⛔ NOT a *stale* kill: prior-day kills auto-clear since 20-Jun | `sudo bash deploy/resume.sh` (`--force` also clears HARD_KILL). ⛔ **NOT `systemctl restart`** and ⛔ **NOT `main.py --resume`** — both fail. Fix the root cause first or it re-trips. Detail: [05_incident_response.md](05_incident_response.md) |
| Kill switch SOFT_KILL at 15:15 | Circuit breaker (expected daily) | FIX-154: auto-clears on restart (no open positions); manual: clear DB + restart |
| IntegrityError fm_ledger.amount | NaN input to reserve() | Fixed in FIX-154 (input validation) |
| data_store read-only | Permissions changed | `sudo chmod 755 data_store/` |
| DB lock contention | External process holding lock | Wait or kill external process |

## 12. Escalation

- **Level 1**: Check logs, restart system
- **Level 2**: Check broker manually, reconcile positions
- **Level 3**: Stop trading, investigate, involve developer

## Known Issues (from Day 0 offline testing)

- Pre-existing invariant failures (A, B, F, G) from historical data: no capital_snapshot, stuck QUEUED signals, missing fm_ledger_COMMIT entries, orphan reservations. These are data quality issues from prior live/paper sessions, not system bugs.
- CT036 (100 concurrent connections): Test harness error in concurrent futures, but system survived and health check passed.
- CT096/CT105/CT117: Scenario runner subprocess issues with `kill -9` commands — manually verified all pass.

## CRASH TEST DATE
