# Extra Findings (EF) — Issues discovered during audit remediation

Findings surfaced while executing Web Claude's audit plan that were NOT in
the original 54-item audit. Logged here so they don't derail the phase
cadence but aren't forgotten.

Severity legend: CRITICAL > HIGH > MED > LOW (same scale as the main audit).

## EF-1 — WebhookReceiver reads flat config path, main.py passes AppConfig

File: signals/webhook_receiver.py (self._config.signal_queue.capacity access)
     main.py:~1072 (passes full AppConfig, signal_queue lives at .system.signal_queue)
Impact: AttributeError on first /health endpoint hit in production
Severity: HIGH (new; not in Web Claude's audit)
Fix size: ~5 lines, same shape-tolerant pattern as BL-18
Status: deferred to Phase E (grouped with H-findings) unless it surfaces earlier
Discovered: Phase 0, during BL-18 shape-resolution work

---

## EF-2 — Track-after-persist race in OrderPlacer.place()

File: orders/order_placer.py (post _persist_entry_orders() block, BL-7c)
Impact: if `order_monitor.track()` raises between `_persist_entry_orders()` and
        the `_fill_map` write (e.g., duplicate internal_id ValueError), the
        orders table has rows but the monitor has no coverage for those
        internal_ids. Those orders will never publish `OrderFilled`, capital
        never commits from the reservation, and the trade row sits in
        PENDING_FILL until the reconciler's orphan-detection path picks it up
        (or EOD square-off forces an exit).
Severity: HIGH latent
Fix size: medium — needs a rollback pathway (cancel broker orders via adapter
         + delete orders rows + release reservation + mark trade FAILED).
         That rollback is its own design exercise because partial-cancel
         semantics differ per broker and the adapter doesn't yet expose a
         bulk-cancel primitive.
Status: deferred to Phase E or later (post paper-trial). A.3.c (BL-7c) added
        the 3-leg track() wiring that makes this race reachable for SL+TGT
        legs too, not just ENTRY — but the gap itself is pre-existing
        (ENTRY leg had the same race before BL-7c).
Discovered: Phase A, A.3.c pre-work grep review (finding S1)

## EF-3 — FundManager.release_used PnL formula was LONG-biased  [RESOLVED]

File: capital/fund_manager.py::release_used
Impact: pre-fix formula `pnl = (exit_price - entry_price) * exit_qty - costs`
        silently produced sign-flipped PnL for every SHORT position. BL-7 had
        kept _on_order_filled from ever running exits, so the bug was dormant —
        A.3.d would have been the first caller to exercise it with real SHORT
        prices. Six of 15 Chartink strategies are SHORT-only; 30-50% of fills
        on any paper day would have posted inverted realized PnL to the daily
        loss limit + reports.
Severity: CRITICAL (mechanism defined, wiring missing; activates on first SHORT exit)
Fix: SUB-STEP 0.5 of A.3.d.
     - release_used now takes a required `direction: str` param (LONG|SHORT);
       ValueError on anything else. `_VALID_DIRECTIONS: frozenset` constant added.
     - Branch: LONG → (exit-entry)*qty; SHORT → (entry-exit)*qty; both minus costs.
     - Docstring documents the sign convention explicitly.
     - Caller updates: order_reconciler._check1_manual_close reads direction from
       the trade row (sqlite3.Row indexing via try/except, with LONG fallback and
       WARNING log). order_placer._handle_exit_fill passes direction from the
       trade row (authoritative) or the cached fill_entry.direction (fallback).
Tests added:
  - test_fund_manager.py: test_release_used_short_profit, test_release_used_short_loss,
    test_release_used_rejects_invalid_direction (+3)
  - test_order_reconciler.py: direction kwarg asserted in MANUAL_CLOSE path
  - test_order_placer.py::TestBl7dExitFillHandling::test_short_tgt_fill_gross_pnl_direction_correct
    (regression guard)
Status: RESOLVED in commit containing BL-7d+BL-10a
Discovered: Phase A, A.3.d pre-work (verification grep of release_used callers)

## EF-4 — paper_capital is not a declared SystemConfig field  [RESOLVED]

File: main.py (getattr(app_config.system, "paper_capital", 500_000.0))
     core/config_loader.py::SystemConfig (field missing)
Impact: paper_capital was fetched from SystemConfig via getattr() with a
        500_000.0 default. This ghost config key was absent from YAML and
        always defaulted to 500k, while AccountRow.paper_capital (from
        accounts.csv, typically 5_000_000) was the authoritative value set
        by SU19 (Module 41). Two silently-diverging sources of truth: the
        adapter's get_margins() returned 500k (stale getattr default) while
        FundManager / SU19 operated on AccountRow.paper_capital. Paper-only
        divergence, but it would have fed stale values into the G3 reconciler
        drift check (see EF-7) and into the pre-flight capital banner.
Severity: MEDIUM (operational footgun, not capital-corruption). Paper-only
          so live PnL is not affected. But the divergence itself masked EF-7.
Fix (E.7 consolidation — setter-based late-bind):
     - Added `ZerodhaAdapter.set_paper_capital(value)` method with validation
       (`value > 0`) and live-mode no-op.
     - main.py: adapter constructed with provisional `paper_capital=0.0`,
       value late-bound via `broker_adapter.set_paper_capital(
       selected_account.paper_capital)` AFTER account selection completes
       (post `_interactive_confirm_live` branch).
     - is_paper re-evaluated after the interactive block (args.mode may have
       flipped between paper and live during the confirm flow).
     - getattr(app_config.system, "paper_capital", ...) deleted from main.py.
     - AccountRow.paper_capital (core/account_registry.py:61, AR11-validated)
       is now the single source of truth.
Tests added (4, in test_zerodha_adapter.py):
  - test_ef4_set_paper_capital_updates_value — setter mutates _paper_capital
  - test_ef4_set_paper_capital_rejects_nonpositive — 0.0, -1.0, -5M → ValueError
  - test_ef4_set_paper_capital_noop_in_live — live mode ignores setter calls
  - test_ef4_no_paper_capital_getattr_in_main — grep-style guard against
    regression (reads main.py as text, asserts the getattr substring absent)
Status: RESOLVED in E.7 commit.
Discovered: Phase A, A.3.f pre-work (grep of paper_mode/is_paper in main.py)
Closed: Phase E, E.7 commit (2026-04-19)

## EF-5 — trades table lacks reservation_id column; linkage is a two-hop query

File: core/schema.sql (trades table definition)
      core/state_store.py::get_reservation_id_for_signal
      capital/fund_manager.py::_replay_open_trade (BL-1 consumer)
Impact: To resolve an OPEN trade to its live FundManager reservation, the
        rehydrate path (BL-1) must go trade.signal_id -> fm_ledger RESERVE
        row (ORDER BY ledger_id DESC LIMIT 1) -> reservation_id. This
        two-hop works because the most-recent RESERVE for a signal is
        authoritative (retries CANCEL earlier ones), but it is a schema-
        level design shortcut that was fine before rehydrate existed --
        nothing else in the system needed the trade -> reservation lookup.
Severity: MEDIUM (operational complexity, not correctness). Replay is
          correct as-is; adding the column would collapse the two-hop
          into a single column access and simplify anomaly reporting.
Fix size: small schema change (trades.reservation_id TEXT nullable), plus
         a backfill query for existing rows (SELECT latest RESERVE per
         signal_id). OrderManager would populate it at capital-reservation
         time; rehydrate would read it directly.
Status: DEFERRED. Not in scope for B.2 / Phase B -- would add schema
        churn to an already-load-bearing commit. Revisit in Phase E or
        a dedicated schema-cleanup commit.
Discovered: Phase B, B.2 pre-work (rehydrate reservation_id lookup design)

## EF-6 — orders-row status cleanup on FAILED-trade path

File: orders/order_placer.py::_handle_placement_failure (broker_order_ids branch)
      core/state_store.py (no update_order_status_to_cancelled helper exists)
Impact: When _handle_placement_failure fires via the EF-2 cleanup path (or the
        pre-existing BL-8 persist-failure path with broker_order_ids supplied),
        the broker orders get cancelled via adapter.cancel_order() and capital
        gets released, but the orders rows already inserted by
        _persist_entry_orders are left with their pre-cancel status (typically
        OPEN or NEW). The trade row transitions to FAILED, but the per-leg
        orders rows misleadingly show active status. Reports (daily_review.py
        MULTI_INNING_TRACKING sheet, anomaly reports) reading the orders table
        for that trade_id will show phantom-active legs until a reconciler
        sweep rewrites them via MANUAL_CLOSE or similar.
Severity: LOW (cosmetic / reporting). Capital tracking is correct, broker
          state is correct, trade row status is correct. Only the per-leg
          orders-row status is stale. Does not cause downstream logic to
          fire because the trade is already FAILED and the monitor has no
          coverage (EF-2 cleanup untracked them; BL-8 never tracked them).
Fix size: small — add state_store.update_order_status(internal_id, status,
         reason) or similar, and have _handle_placement_failure call it for
         each broker_order_id after cancel_order() returns. Needs a status
         value choice (CANCELLED? FAILED_TO_TRACK?) and a schema audit to
         confirm it's in the existing CHECK constraint.
Status: DEFERRED. Filed 2026-04-19 at E.6 landing. Revisit when the orders
        table schema gets its next structural pass, or when reporting
        accuracy becomes a paper-trial follow-up. Not urgent for paper cut.
Discovered: Phase E, E.6 pre-work (EF-2 track-failure cleanup design)

## EF-6a — paper-mode synth-fill race vs cancel

File: broker/zerodha_adapter.py (ZA16a paper synth thread)
      orders/order_placer.py::_handle_placement_failure (cancel_order loop)
Impact: In paper mode, place_order spawns a daemon thread that sleeps
        paper_auto_fill_delay_sec (default 0.5s) and then publishes
        OrderFilled for that broker_order_id. When _handle_placement_failure
        iterates broker_order_ids and calls cancel_order() on each, there
        is a race where the synth thread may publish OrderFilled between
        _persist_entry_orders returning and cancel_order() completing.
        Because EF-2 cleanup pops the _fill_map entry before cancelling,
        the published OrderFilled will hit OrderPlacer with no _fill_map
        entry (silent drop via the existing "unknown internal_id" branch)
        -- capital stays consistent, but the EF-2 log line "cancelled
        broker_order_ids" is misleading if a fill beat the cancel.
Severity: LOW (paper-mode-only; live broker cancellations are synchronous
          via Kite API and do not have this synth-thread quirk). No capital
          or state corruption risk.
Fix size: small -- either (a) flag the broker order as "cancel_pending"
         in a paper-side set before calling cancel_order(), have the synth
         thread check the flag before publishing; or (b) cancel_order() in
         paper mode raises if the synth thread has already fired (currently
         it returns success regardless). Option (b) is cleaner but requires
         threading coordination primitives in the paper adapter path.
Status: DEFERRED. Filed 2026-04-19 at E.6 landing. Paper-only quirk;
        will not survive into live. Revisit if paper-trial produces
        confusing logs where EF-2 cleanup claims to cancel orders that
        actually filled.
Discovered: Phase E, E.6 pre-work (EF-2 test-harness design for paper
            synth mock parity)

## EF-7 — G3 reconciler drift check read stale paper capital  [AUTO-RESOLVED by E.7]

File: orders/order_reconciler.py::_g3_capital_drift
     broker/zerodha_adapter.py::get_margins (paper-mode branch)
Impact: The G3 capital-drift reconciler check compares FundManager state
        against `adapter.get_margins()["equity"]["net"]`. In paper mode,
        before E.7 that value was the adapter's `_paper_capital`, which was
        bound at constructor time from the getattr(app_config.system,
        "paper_capital", 500_000.0) default — NOT from
        AccountRow.paper_capital (the post-SU19 authoritative value,
        typically 5_000_000). Result: on every G3 tick in paper mode, the
        reconciler compared FundManager's view of a 5M account against a
        500k adapter number and would have emitted spurious
        `capital_drift` escalations — or worse, masked a real drift by
        showing a consistent stale value.
Severity: HIGH latent (paper-trial would have produced alert noise within
          minutes; live mode unaffected since adapter.get_margins() reads
          real Kite margins).
Fix: AUTO-RESOLVED by E.7 setter consolidation. Once main.py calls
     `broker_adapter.set_paper_capital(selected_account.paper_capital)`
     after account selection, the adapter's `_paper_capital` and
     FundManager's capital both derive from the same AccountRow source,
     eliminating the divergence. No reconciler code change needed.
Tests: covered indirectly by the EF-4 test set — the setter-update test
       guarantees get_margins() reflects AccountRow.paper_capital, which
       is what G3 consumes.
Status: AUTO-RESOLVED by E.7 (no standalone commit).
Discovered: Phase E, E.7 pre-work (grep of get_margins callers while
            designing the EF-4 setter approach)
Closed: Phase E, E.7 commit (2026-04-19)

## FUTURE-1 — auto-start trading-system.service on token arrival  [DEFERRED]

File: deploy/systemd/trading-system.service (no .path unit today)
     scripts/copy_token_to_vm.bat (manual SCP from PC)
Impact: operator workflow today is:
         1. PC: python scripts/zerodha_login.py --account LFL836
         2. PC: scripts/copy_token_to_vm.bat  (manual double-click)
         3. VM: ssh in + sudo systemctl start trading-system.service
        Step 3 is manual. Green-light considered adding a systemd .path
        unit watching the token file so the service auto-starts when the
        token arrives, closing the loop to "PC push -> VM auto-start."
Severity: LOW (operator-convenience, not capital/correctness). Day-1 of
          paper trial is hands-on anyway, so the manual step is fine.
Fix size: small (new .path unit + possibly an idempotency wrapper to
         avoid restarting a running service on re-push).
Status: DEFERRED. Three variants surfaced during F.1 pre-work:
        (a) .path unit with PathChanged + idempotency guard,
        (b) .timer unit with fixed 09:00 IST kickoff (relies on token
            being on VM by then),
        (c) continue manual.
        Variant selection needs real paper-trial observations (how
        often does the operator re-push mid-session? does a restart
        mid-session corrupt in-flight orders? etc.). Choose after Week 1
        paper trial surfaces the operational pattern.
Discovered: Phase F, F.1 pre-work (headless token-handoff mechanism
            analysis)
