# FRIDAY MORNING — 07-Aug-2026 · ⛔ ONE SCREEN. RECORD, DO NOT ACT.

> # ⛔⛔ **STANDING INSTRUCTION — READ BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE**
> # **DO NOT MANUALLY BUY ATULAUTO while GTT `330657774` rests.**
> ⭐ **The system CANNOT re-enter** — the phantom `OPEN` row blocks the symbol through the
> product-blind gates. ⇒ **a manual buy is the ONLY path by which that stale sell can fire on real
> shares.** ⛔ This holds until the GTT is gone, not until the trade looks closed.

## 1. 🔴 THE MEASUREMENT OF THE WEEK — AND IT IS FREE

**At the first `cnc_gtt_monitor` cycle after boot — compare ALL THREE VIEWS BEFORE any corrective
action.** ⭐ The `−1` row is **one input**, not the question; the **convergence** is the question.

| view | read it from | Friday's value |
|---|---|---|
| **① BROKER TRUTH** | `get_positions` / `get_holdings` in today's log | |
| **② RESERVATION REPLAY** | `fm_ledger` by `reservation_id` (see §2) | |
| **③ INTERNAL STATE** | `trades.status` + `gtt_state.status` | |

- ✅ **ALL THREE AGREE ⇒ the replay is EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR.** Record and move on.
- 🔴 **THEY DIVERGE ⇒ DIAGNOSE BEFORE REMEDIATING.** ⛔ **No corrective action on a surprising
  reading** — the reflex to "fix" a divergence is exactly what this ordering forbids.

**The ATULAUTO sub-question, as one input into ①:**

| outcome | mechanism | what follows |
|---|---|---|
| **GONE** | `held = 0` ⇒ `:487` opens ⇒ **branch 4 fires** | ⭐ trade closes · **₹587.40 released** · resting GTT `330657774` deleted · slot freed · symbol unblocked |
| **SURVIVES** | `abs()` at `:464` ⇒ `held = 1` | `healthy:ATULAUTO`, **nothing changes**, the phantom persists another day |

⭐⭐ **It settles a broker-behaviour fact nobody could establish from source, and it decides how
urgent F6's build is.** ⛔ **Record it either way. DO NOT act on it.**
⚠️ **And do not read a matched count as health:** on 06-Aug `2 positions == 2 rows` held **because
the phantom exists on BOTH sides.** **An equality can be arithmetically clean and still wrong.**

> ### 🔴🔴 **IT IS NOT ONLY A DIAGNOSTIC — IT DECIDES AN OPERATIONAL BURDEN**
> · **`−1` row GONE** ⇒ `held = 0` ⇒ branch 4 fires ⇒ the phantom closes ⇒ ✅ **THE NIGHTLY-STOP
>   OBLIGATION ENDS** *(DIFFNKG still defers the 17:35 self-exit — but a real carry is a real
>   reason, and it clears when it sells)*.
> · **`−1` row SURVIVES** ⇒ ⛔ **THE OBLIGATION STANDS INDEFINITELY: a manual stop EVERY trading
>   night until F6 lands.**
> ⭐⭐ **Why it matters this much:** no stop ⇒ no boot ⇒ the day's routine 15:15 `SOFT_KILL` never
> clears (both clearers are boot-only) ⇒ **the next trading day opens with no entries at all**, and
> it presents as **"no signals today" — indistinguishable from a quiet market.**
> ⚠️⚠️ **AND TONIGHT'S STOP IS FRIDAY'S — A MISSED *FRIDAY* STOP COSTS *MONDAY*,** three days after
> the mistake, because the weekend is not a trading day.
> ⛔ **Cancelling the GTT is NOT a cheaper fix** — the `abs()` phantom keeps `held == row_qty`, so
> `cnc_gtt_monitor.py:513` recreates it (or queues it pre-open for the first in-hours cycle).
> **The only levers are the nightly stop, or F6.**

**Baseline to compare against (P, measured 06-Aug 19:08:38):** `get_positions` → **`2 positions`**;
`get_holdings` → **`0 holdings`** (15:23:40). Both trades still `OPEN`, both `gtt_state` `ACTIVE`.

```bash
ssh trading-vm 'cd /home/ubuntu/systems/trading-system
grep "get_positions call_end" logs/system_$(date +%F).log | tail -2
grep -E "cnc_gtt_monitor|healthy:ATULAUTO" logs/system_$(date +%F).log | head -20'
```

## 2. THE STANDARD BOOT CHECKS

- **Token file FIRST** — ⛔ a failed 08:15 refresh is **SILENT**: no token ⇒ no watcher start ⇒ no
  boot, **no error, no alert.** *"No order today"* has two causes; this distinguishes them.
- **Branch** · **kill cleared** (`clear_stale_state` runs at boot **only**).
- **The boot seed** — seed = `broker.net − carryover` (carryover is **0** at 08:15).
  ⚠️ **Both CNC reservations replay again:** ATULAUTO **₹587.40** (`ee9af41eae554c35`) — **the
  phantom** — plus DIFFNKG **₹446.10** (`0184b66d4c214416`) = **₹1,033.50**.
  ⛔ **KEY ON `reservation_id`, NEVER `trade_id`** — only 1.9 % of `fm_ledger` rows carry a
  `trade_id`, so a `trade_id` query returns **EMPTY**, which reads as *"capital released"*: a
  **certain false alarm on the one morning it matters.**
  **(P) 06-Aug:** both show `RESERVE → COMMIT`, **neither has a RELEASE row.**

## 3. ⚠️ IF THE STOP WAS **NOT** TAKEN — the Thursday process is still running

⭐ **The counters are FINE — this was measured at source on 06-Aug** (`STOP_PROCEDURE_06-Aug-2026.md`
§4): the daily-trade cap, both daily-loss halves, consecutive-losses and the strategy governor all
**re-read the clock per call** and query **by date**; FIX-051 removed the in-memory P&L accumulator
entirely, so **no stale P&L state exists to go wrong.**

⛔ **What IS boot-bound simply never re-runs — check these two, in this order:**
1. 🔴🔴 **THE KILL IS STILL `SOFT_KILL` AND THERE ARE NO ENTRIES TODAY.** Not a risk — a
   **certainty**, if there was no boot. **(P) 06-Aug 15:15:01.115** the breaker fired
   (`circuit_breaker_force_close_15:15`, `order_monitor`) and **(S)** *both* clearers are
   **boot-only** (`main.py:1914` / `:1919`). ⭐ **Direction is RESTRICTIVE — entries blocked =
   fail-safe, ⛔ not permissive.** ⇒ **Read "no trades today" as THIS, not as a signal drought.**
   ✅ **If the boot DID happen, expect the mirror of today's 08:15 line** — *"Kill switch
   auto-cleared: prior SOFT_KILL from 2026-08-06 … new day starts clean (HEADLESS)"* — and
   ⭐ **it clears even with positions open** (`clear_stale_state` ignores them; the no-open-position
   condition belongs to the *same-day* path). **Confirm that line before anything else.**
2. **The capital seed is Thursday's** (`initialize()`, FM13 *"once at startup"*) — never re-seeded
   from `broker.net`. ⚠️ The SU6 holiday guard (`main.py:1754`) is also stale but **inert today**
   (Friday is a trading day).

## 4. 📐 A CALIBRATION TEST IF — **and only if** — an MIS trade fires today

⛔ **PASSIVE. NO TRADE IS TO BE PLACED FOR THIS.** ⭐ **If no MIS trade fires, the question ROLLS.**

**With `LIMIT_TRIPLE`'s SL and TGT both resting after a fill, does the broker charge margin for the
second?** ⇒ ⭐⭐ **it decides whether the intraday divisor is 1 or 2 — a FACTOR OF TWO on every
intraday position.**

> ⭐⭐ **THIS IS A CALIBRATION TEST, ⛔ NOT "record three numbers."** The upgrade is deliberate: a
> reading with no stated confidence and no recorded conditions **cannot be re-used and cannot be
> challenged** — it becomes a number someone later quotes without knowing what it was worth.

### 4.1 · CAPTURE — **FOUR readings, each with its clock time**

1. Kite **Funds → `used margin`** *before* the first MIS entry fills;
2. **`used margin` again after BOTH exits are resting** *(i.e. the deferred `place_exits` has run —
   ⛔ not merely after the entry fills)*;
3. **the position's own value**, for the comparison;
4. **available funds**, at the same two moments as (1) and (2).

### 4.2 · THEN DOCUMENT — **FOUR fields, as permanent evidence rather than a note**

| field | what it must say |
|---|---|
| **the observed divisor** | **1** or **2** — the arithmetic, not the impression |
| **the confidence** | ⭐ what the reading *cannot* settle, stated in the same breath as what it does |
| **the broker conditions at the time** | segment, product, whether any other position was open, time of day — ⛔ **a margin reading is a reading of the WHOLE account, not of one order** |
| **is a REPEAT verification required?** | ✅ **yes/no with the reason.** ⭐ A single observation on a single symbol on a single day is a **calibration point**, ⛔ not a broker rule |

### 4.3 · ⛔ STILL PASSIVE, AND A ROLL IS AN OUTCOME

⛔ **No trade is placed for it.** ⭐ **If no MIS trade fires today it ROLLS — and a roll is a
LEGITIMATE OUTCOME under the sizing thread's exit criterion (B)** *("the intraday margin observation
completed, **or explicitly ROLLED**")*, ⛔ **not a miss.** 🏷️ **Record the roll explicitly; an
unrecorded roll is indistinguishable from forgetting.**

### 4.4 · ⚠️ THE ASYMMETRY — **kept here, where it will actually be read**

> **Divisor 2 assumed as 1 ⇒ positions DOUBLE-SIZED against the intended cap.**
> **Divisor 1 assumed as 2 ⇒ merely HALF-sized.**
> 🔴 **THE DANGEROUS DIRECTION IS THE ONE CURRENTLY ASSUMED.**

⛔ **Record only. No sizing change follows without the full loop.** ➡️ `docs/design/sizing/sizing_thread_conclusions_06aug2026.md` §1.1a

## 5. DIFFNKG's CHECK1 GATE — it carries into Friday

⛔ **The same three checks**, and the one that matters: **an ACTIVE `gtt_state` row with a NULL or
mismatched `trade_id` DOES NOT SKIP.** **(P) 06-Aug 19:08:44:** `330658430 → trd_010f8e21…` matched
exactly. ⚠️ `_check_stuck_exiting` is **UNGUARDED**; the broker cancel (`:1264`) runs **before** the
product read (`:1271`).

---

⛔ **DO NOT:** act on §1 · manually buy ATULAUTO · close the phantom by hand · treat a quiet morning
as a healthy one without §2's token check.
