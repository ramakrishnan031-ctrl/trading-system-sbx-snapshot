# Pending-List Reconciliation — 14-Jul-2026 (read-only census)

**Task:** Reconcile `MASTER_PENDING_TRUE_FINAL_10JUL.txt` against the actual repo/ledger/audits at HEAD.
**HEAD:** `2dc69d5` (deployed). **Landed batch since 10-Jul:** `bb9b1e7..2dc69d5` (36 commits = Q4+Q5+P11+deploy).
**Method:** commit-log M-ID map (`git log --all`), code spot-checks at HEAD, config flag reads, VM read-only checks. No code/config/VM changed.
**Anti-dup (Section 7):** no prior reconciliation/census doc existed — this is the first.

> **Verdict key:** CLOSED (evidence pointer) · OPEN (still pending) · PARTIAL (half shipped — which half stated) · STALE (premise false / subsystem gone) · UNKNOWN (evidence named). Where an item has both paper+live paths, CLOSED requires both.

## Section B — CLOSED (with SHAs)
Landed in `bb9b1e7..2dc69d5` (36 commits) unless noted:
- **Q4 capital-safety:** gate-8 sector-TOCTOU `330fa38`+`9050ba9`+`7c76408` (verified `capital/risk_engine.py:254/313/351`); kill_switch=None boot fail-fast `8ea1a4e` (verified `main.py:2177`); structure_exit∩trailing_sl guard `c1eea66`.
- **Q5 Wave-7:** M-K1 `4ec9a9c` · M-R1 `aea9bb6` · M-R2 `9a303ee` · M-R3 `342b871` · M-R4 `23ddd29` · M-SC2 `522da32` · M-SC3 `501d14f` · M-S2 `735a6c3` · M-S5 `976fa51`+`b549c27` · M-S6 `b3a5c94` · M-A1 `c0cf3ee` · M-K4 `618222e` · M-X2 `a8d8164` · P10 eod_cleanup `2e61fad` · P5 alert-watcher --loop `34c2993` · quote-noise `c22a25c` · soak-report `9550dfd`.
- **P11:** migration-on-open guard `ed1c4b9`.
- **Earlier (≤bb9b1e7, still at HEAD):** Wave-6 M-O1/O2/C7/C3, P1 SHADOW `f135fee`, schema fail-fast `0b816dc`, PUSH-1 `dd4f3f4`/`9bcc1eb`, trade_type `8116b74`, risk-config `61ae9cc`, all H-1..H-13. GUI Tailscale (G2c). P0-1 boot verify (ledger). P0-5 Wave-7 resumed.

## Section C — OPEN, re-prioritised by CURRENT risk
1. **Finding-1 — `trades.sector` NULL → 40% sector cap never fires** (DISCOVERED, Section G). Blocks D1. Highest latent capital-safety gap.
2. **M-S4 (PARTIAL)** — 25/100 score points dead in the LIVE scorer; distorts every selection. Fix gated on re-parity+re-soak.
3. **P0-3 / DG-3 P1 authoritative flip** — the last Audit-B P&L HIGH stays unclosed while SHADOW.
4. **M-C4 / M-C8 / M-K4-family capital+kill safety MEDs** (M-C4 lock-held-through-send, M-C8 fill-thread starvation) — safety-adjacent, unfixed.
5. **Audit-B Phases 9-10 never completed** — an entire Operations+Security audit slice is unaudited (not "clean").
Then: H-6 + DEL cluster (delivery-gated), backups-DR HIGH, M-S3/S7/S8, M-O3/O5/O9, M-K2/K3/K6, Phase-6 recs, Phase-8 data-quality, all P4 arch/LOW, CO gate, backlog.

## Section D — PARTIAL (which half shipped)
| Item | Shipped | NOT shipped | Flag + value |
|---|---|---|---|
| M-S4 | substrate: schema v44 `daily_symbol_stats`, `candle_math.rsi`, `core.daily_stats`, forward-shadow recorder+cron (5 commits, collecting out-of-sample) | the live scorer fix — `secondary_screener.py:407 "atr": None` unchanged; steps 1&3 still 0.0 | `v3_hardgate_mode:"shadow"`, `min_pass_score:60` (live), `v3_min_pass_score:50` (inert) |
| M-DP1 | LIVE + canonical `deploy/hooks/post-receive` = `/systems/` (deploys land) | stale duplicate `deploy/post-receive` still `CHECKOUT=/home/ubuntu/trading-system` | — |
| P1-3 VM security | Q8 investigation complete (no breach) | controls C1/C2/C3/C5 (deferred by Rama) | `authoritative`-style: n/a |
| P3-sys integration tests | Q7 `4fe9188` wired scenarios for gate-8×2/M-S5/M-S2 | coverage of every raw-SQL money path + per-safety-layer wired-in assertion | — |
| P3-s14 webhook insert-fail | M-S2 dedup-poison `735a6c3` | insert-fail observability/dark-window logging | — |
| C-d P1 deploy | deployed SHADOW, schema v44 | authoritative flip | `authoritative:false` |
| P5-1 credentials rule | secret-scan hook, `.env` gitignored, `.env.example` placeholder | credentials.xlsx-specific rule (unverified) | — |

## Section E — STALE (premise false / subsystem gone)
- **P1-3 "foreign-IP SSH incident + time-lock failed"** — Q8 proved NO breach; the 18:00–08:00 "time-lock" is `scripts/copy_gate.py` (VM→PC copies), was **never an SSH control**; the "foreign IP" was a brute-force bot with 0 successes; the "unexpected key" was Rama's own un-baselined rotation. *(The exact precedent Section 5e warns about — we nearly hardened a fiction.)*
- **M-D1 candle volume semantics** — investigated → `volume_traded` is CUMULATIVE and only latent under MODE_LTP (unused); no change needed (ledger).
- **C-j "PC=VM=bare @ 8116b74 / ledger EMPTY"** — superseded by 4 deploys (`c1ad82e`→`5a71fb6`→`277d63e`→`2dc69d5`); ledger now carries T2 + Q8.
- **M-O1** (already self-noted false-positive in the 10-Jul list; NSE:NSE: double-prefix was a non-bug) — confirmed, has a defensive commit but premise was false.

## Section F — UNKNOWN (evidence needed)
- **DG-1 S&R V2 BIR-outcome count** — fills gate MET (146 closed ≥ ~50), but the 8-10 "BIR-filled W/L" count cannot be auto-derived. *Need:* Rama's manual zone-marking pass over `scripts/sr_level_export.py` output joined to filled-trade outcomes; or a BIR-classification query on `sr_detector_results`. Until then the calibration PASS/RECALIBRATE decision is unresolvable.

## Section G — DISCOVERED (pending, never on any list)
1. **Finding-1 — `trades.sector` is NULL on 100% of rows → `StateStore.sector_exposure()` returns 0 for the resting book → the 40% sector cap has NEVER summed open positions** (a control that reports PASS while doing nothing). Harmless today (~₹198/pos « ₹3,957 cap) but **D1 (raise concentration) is BLOCKED until `trades.sector` is populated at insert.** gate-8's TOCTOU fix is real but its resting-book term is structurally 0 = INCOMPLETE. Source: `pb01_shadow_deploy_14jul` / Q8. **Not on the 10-Jul list.**
2. **No active exit-management engine** — `order_protocol` dead-config → 100% LIMIT_TRIPLE → naked SL/TGT/15:17-squareoff (`sl_trail_count=0/134`); corrects the "Step-8 SmartTgt = sole live SL owner" claim. Source: `naked_trades_order_protocol_dead_13jul`. Partially overlaps CO-GATE but the "no exit engine live" framing was never tracked.
3. **Stale `deploy/post-receive` duplicate** with wrong `/home/ubuntu/trading-system` path — a silent-no-op footgun if ever installed (the canonical `deploy/hooks/post-receive` is correct). Cleanup item, on no list.
4. **Q8 docs uncommitted** — `docs/audit/q8_vm_security_breach_forensics_14jul2026.md` (untracked) + `PATHS.md`/`SYSTEM_MAP.md` (modified) sit in the working tree, unpushed (Section 4 answer).

## Section H — FLAG / SCAFFOLDING INVENTORY (current values at HEAD)
| Flag | Value | Migration status |
|---|---|---|
| `scoring.v3_hardgate_mode` | `"shadow"` | INCOMPLETE — soak ≥5 sessions before enforce; scaffolding legitimately present |
| `system.portfolio_allocator.allocator_mode` | `"shadow"` | INCOMPLETE — regret-observer only; enforce gated |
| `system.v3_chain_mode` | `"shadow"` | ACTIVE (binary off\|shadow; no enforce in 10a by design) |
| `eod_broker_reconcile.authoritative` | `false` | INCOMPLETE — P1 SHADOW; flip pending (P0-3) |
| `watchlist.enabled` | `true` | ACTIVE — PB-01 capture/entry, analysis-only (no order) |
| `strategies/pb01_breakout_retest.enabled` | `false` (+`v3_playbook:true`) | fail-closed by design |
| `regime.enabled` | `false` | off (not constructed) |
| `sr_detector.intraday_anchors_enabled` | `false` | off (awaits manual marking) |
| `shadow_tracker.enabled` | `true` | active (multi-inning) |
| `smart_tgt.enabled` | `true` | active (live SL owner) |
| `structure_exit_enabled` | `false` | off (single-SL-owner rule; Q4c guard now enforces) |
| `wait_for_retest_enabled` | `false` | off (M-S6 path dormant) |
| `force_intraday_only` / `trade_type` / `delivery_enabled` | `true` / `INTRADAY` / `false` | delivery TRIPLE-LOCKED |
| `require_hmac` | `false` | C-2 Option-B (reverse-proxy+HMAC) not yet built |
| `min_pass_score` / `v3_min_pass_score` | `60` / `50` | live 60; v3 50 inert until enforce |
| `EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` | `44` | live DB migrated (Q8-confirmed) |
| P5 alert-watcher `--loop` | default-off | shipped `34c2993`, opt-in |

**Scaffolding that will need removal once migration proven:** `v3_hardgate_mode`, `allocator_mode` (both shadow → enforce → remove FCFS/OLD path); `authoritative` (→ retire eod_verify). None are removable yet (soak incomplete). First-party TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK census: **1 / 0 / 1 / 0** (venv-excluded) — codebase is markedly clean of debt markers.

## Section I — Audit-B Phases 9-10
**ABSENT / NEVER COMPLETED.** `audit_05jul2026.md` ends at line 819: *"Batch 5 running (Agent-I: Operations …; Agent-J: Security posture). Phases 1–8 are consolidated in the report."* No Phase-9 or Phase-10 deliverable exists in the repo (searched `docs/audit/`). Coverage-matrix §4 corroborates ("Cannot confirm — Phases 9 and 10 are not in the uploaded file"). **Consequence:** an Operations + Security audit slice was never produced. Some subject matter was addressed piecemeal since (the stuck alert-watcher/security-watcher — Phase-9's stated priority — are now live and delivering; Q8 covered part of the Security-posture ground and found no breach), **but the formal Phases 9-10 remain PENDING, not clean.** Treat as OPEN.

## Section J — Coverage-matrix integrity
The `coverage_matrix_05jul2026.md` map remains **accurate for the audits it covers** (Audit A + Audit B Phases 1-8): every labelled finding maps to a wave/gate/track, and §2 "Uncovered findings: None" still holds — no Audit A/B finding is unmapped. **Caveat:** three material issues discovered *after* 05-Jul fall outside the matrix by construction and are tracked only in the ledger/memory (now also Section G here): Finding-1 (`trades.sector` NULL), the no-active-exit-engine framing, and the Q8 security findings. The matrix's own §4 correctly flagged Phases 9-10 as absent — that flag is still live (Section I).

## Honest closure statement (§9)
Every item on the 10-Jul list has a verdict with an evidence pointer. **If the two source files were deleted tomorrow, nothing pending would be lost** — this document + the ledger + memory carry it — **with two explicit exceptions to name:** (1) the **DG-1 S&R BIR-outcome count is UNKNOWN** and depends on Rama's manual zone-marking (not recoverable from code alone); (2) **Audit-B Phases 9-10 were never produced**, so their unaudited findings are unknowable until that audit is run. Both are stated, not hidden.
