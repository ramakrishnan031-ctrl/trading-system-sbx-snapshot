# EFFECT-VERIFICATION TELEMETRY — PHASE A FROZEN CONTRACT (01-Aug-2026)

**Ledger item:** debt ledger §XE.3 **#1** (`docs/audit/integrity_audit_2026.md`) — families
**β (structural starvation)** + **γ (algebraic unreachability)**. Family α (BK-8
schema↔ctor) is **OUT of this card** — separate next iteration.
**Status:** `<PENDING — Phase A contract FROZEN; GATE awaiting Rama's approval>`.
⛔ **NO CODE EXISTS YET. Phase B does not begin until Rama relays approval of this
contract.** (Implementation card, GATE after A5.)

**Measured on:** the PC tree at `b4e3dac` whose **code files are byte-identical to the
deployed `297b587`** (verified: `git diff --name-only 297b587..HEAD -- '*.py' '*.yaml'
'*.sh'` → empty, 01-Aug 15:40 IST). Every file:line below is therefore a line in the
audited, deployed code.

**Companion artifact (the C2/C6 single source of truth):**
`config/expected_managers.yaml` — the expected-manager/expected-state registry, frozen in
the same commit. ⛔ **Review rule from this commit forward: a new manager ctor in main.py
REQUIRES a registry entry in the same diff.**

---

## A1 — THE COMPOSITION ROOT, ENUMERATED (main.py ctor sites)

**Single construction path, both modes:** `main()` builds every manager identically in
paper and live; `is_paper` alters only (a) adapter internals (`paper_mode=` main.py:2008,
paper quote provider :2012, paper capital seeds :2205/:2419), (b) **BrokerClockSkewProbe
— the ONE mode-conditional ctor** (live-only, main.py:3384-3386, documented rationale in
code), (c) start-time no-ops (token_monitor no-op in paper, :3435 comment). ⇒ the B2
startup assertion and the census run on the SAME code path in both modes; the registry
carries exactly one mode-conditional entry.

## A2 — THE FROZEN "ACTED" CONTRACT — one effect-point per unit

**The C1 rule as applied:** one registry entry = one effect-point = one counter. An
entry is either a **constructed manager** (β detection: constructed-but-starved) or an
**audit-named branch inside one** (γ detection: reachable-in-code, algebraically never —
γ is INVISIBLE to manager-level counters, so the card's own γ anchors force exactly these
sub-units, and no others were invented). "Acted" always means the CONSEQUENTIAL effect
(placed / modified / persisted / fired / bound / rejected), never invocation.

### A2.1 — Manager-level units (β)

| unit | ctor | effect-point (file:line) | "acted" means | expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kill_switch` | main:1861 | `capital/kill_switch.py:859` `_persist_state` — **counting ONLY `SOFT_KILL`/`HARD_KILL` states** (activation sites :552/:652 route through it; INACTIVE clears :311/:378/:703 deliberately NOT counted — one point, one documented predicate) | a kill ACTIVATION persisted (persist-first design) | **ACTIVE** — the 15:15 breaker guarantees ≥1/trading day |
| `fund_manager` | main:2333 | `capital/fund_manager.py:2354` `_write_ledger` (the single writer; 10 internal callers) | an fm_ledger row written | **ACTIVE** — daily INIT guarantees ≥1 |
| `position_sizer` | main:2428 | `capital/position_sizer.py:176` `calculate` verdict return | a sizing verdict produced (incl. rejections) | **ACTIVE** (~20-49/day) |
| `risk_engine` | main:2481 | `capital/risk_engine.py:189` `approve` verdict return | an approve/reject verdict issued | **ACTIVE** (~20-49/day) |
| `signal_processor` | main:3058 | `signals/signal_processor.py:1230` — the `_process_one` dispatch `self._placer.place(` | an approved entry DISPATCHED to placement | **ACTIVE** (zero-trade-day caveat §A2.4) — ⚠️ see GATE-Q4: resume-path dispatch sites :1995/:2272 EXCLUDED (production-unreachable — IA-P2-01, retest off; their awakening surfaces at `entry_gate`/retest units first; same shape as IA-P2-06) |
| `secondary_screener` | main:2826 | `screening/secondary_screener.py:592` `_persist` (P18 trail — all verdict paths route through it, :157-:279) | a screening verdict persisted | **ACTIVE** (thousands/day) |
| `quality_scorer` | main:2808 | `screening/quality_scorer.py:121` `return ScoreResult(` | a composite score produced | **ACTIVE** (thousands/day) |
| `hard_gate` | main:2820 | `screening/hard_gate.py:135` `evaluate` verdict | a V3 hardgate verdict produced (shadow) | **ACTIVE** — if census reads 0, IA-P2-05's shadow leg broke further: investigate, do NOT reclassify |
| `order_placer` | main:2639 | **[AMENDED B-2, approved]** `orders/order_placer.py` `place()` — the single PUBLIC placement entry (def :864 at freeze) | an entry-placement request executed | **ACTIVE** (zero-trade-day caveat) — *original row superseded; see §AMENDMENTS* |
| `limit_protocol` | main:2596 | `orders/order_protocol_limit.py:167` `execute` | a LIMIT_TRIPLE entry sequence executed | **ACTIVE** (423/423 historical; zero-trade-day caveat) |
| `order_monitor` | main:2576 | `broker/order_monitor.py:1207` `_safe_transition` commit | an order state transition committed | **ACTIVE** (zero-order-day caveat) |
| `order_reconciler` | main:2702 | `orders/order_reconciler.py:615` `reconcile_once` return — count += len(actions) (RC20: "the list of ReconciliationActions TAKEN") | a reconciliation action enacted (CHECK1 finalizations dominate) | **ACTIVE** (zero-trade-day caveat: clean cycles return `[]`) |
| `eod_squareoff` | main:2844 | `orders/eod_squareoff.py:320` `_fire` completion (`EodFireResult` produced) | an EOD square-off sequence executed | **ACTIVE** — ≥1/trading day |
| `sr_detector` | main:2979 | `sr_detector/detector.py:254` `_write` | an sr_detector_results row written | **ACTIVE** (~11/day; observes sized candidates) |
| `v3_chain_runner` | main:3165 | `v3_chain/runner.py:272` `fh.write(...)` | a V3 would-be observation appended | **ACTIVE** (shadow accrues daily — IA-P2-05 measured 2k+/mode) |
| `pb01_capture_worker` | main:3214 | `v3_chain/watchlist_capture.py:131` `_capture` — the ROW write | a pb01_watchlist ROW WRITTEN — ⛔ **rows, never `queued=`** (memory `silent_failure_gaps_25jul`: the heartbeat records queued, the row count is the only proof) | **ACTIVE** (12-18/night) |
| `pb01_entry_stage` | main:3223 | `v3_chain/pb01_entry.py:318` `_terminate` (→ `update_pb01_watchlist_status` :322) | a watchlist row driven to a TERMINAL status | **ACTIVE** (statuses reconcile 17==17 daily) |
| `portfolio_allocator` | main:3118 | `allocation/portfolio_allocator.py:144` `_process_window` completion | a shadow allocation window adjudicated | **ACTIVE** (0 only on no-candidate days) |
| `webhook_receiver` | main:2892 | **COVERED-EXISTING** — no new counter; census line derived from `webhook_audit` day-count (WR13 `finally`, `webhook_receiver.py:498-503` — every POST outcome path writes it; IA-P1-04's pre-try hole noted, not scanner-selective) | a POST audited | **ACTIVE** (thousands/day) |

### A2.2 — Event-driven units (0 and >0 both normal — GATE-Q1)

| unit | effect-point | "acted" means | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mis_blocklist` | `core/mis_blocklist.py:81` `record_block` (sole path to `_persist_locked` :141 — observation-card-verified) | a broker MIS-block learned + persisted | F5 class; acted 27-Jul, 30-Jul |
| `drift_handler` | `capital/drift_handler.py:135` `_handle` — an enacted outcome (any tier) | a drift ladder action enacted | CapitalDriftDetected is rare by construction (IA-P6-01) |
| `pb01_would_be_runner` | `v3_chain/pb01_runner.py:246` `fh.write(...)` | a PB-01 would-be verdict appended (on confirm) | confirms are rare by design |

### A2.3 — Dormant units: the β/γ tripwires (acted > 0 ⇒ MISMATCH — the finding class going live or a dormancy decision being violated)

| unit | effect-point | why dormant (register ID) |
|---|---|---|
| `entry_gate` | `screening/entry_gate.py:283` `add` | **IA-P2-01** — constructed, started, EOD-cleared; nothing has EVER put an entry into it (divert unwired, EG14/EG15 deferred). `add()` firing = someone wired it |
| `smart_tgt` | `orders/smart_tgt_manager.py:588` `self._adapter.modify_order(` | starved: protocol never assigned (`order_placer.py:949` unconditional default — X6); `modify_order` NEVER executed in production; exits thread CLOSED |
| `tgt_retry` | `orders/tgt_retry_manager.py:306` `retry_tgt_for_trade` outcome | constructed-idle: 26 boot lines, 0 acts (P4.2 census; NOCIL gate: `sl_unplaceable` 0 ever) |
| `co_protocol` | `orders/order_protocol_co.py:87` `execute` | CO never used: 805/805 orders `variety=regular`; 12/15 YAMLs declare CO_PLUS_TGT and :949 discards it (X6, 5-Jul "loaded gun") |
| `shadow_tracker` | `orders/shadow_tracker.py:461` `_start_simulated_inning` (the inning row write) | SH13 `shadow.enabled: false` (yaml :402) — DISABLED 25-Jul (`d31759f`, X4 fabrication; VOID set stays) |
| `live_feed` | `data/live_feed.py:167` `subscribe` | **DORMANT BY DECISION** (`e754c7e`): 32 connects, 0 tokens ever. ⭐ This counter ENFORCES **IA-P1-06** — the dormancy is otherwise un-enforced (`order_placer.py:3393` calls subscribe on the exit-retry path; acted>0 = the decision silently ended) |
| `candle_persist` | `main.py:3399` `_persist_candle` (registered :3415) | X8: must stay dark EVEN IF the feed wires — the 15:40 fetch covers the table with TRUE delta volume; this writer would be strictly worse |
| `sizer.risk_bind` (γ) | `capital/position_sizer.py:407` — the `min()` resolving to `qty_by_risk` | **IA-P3-04**: risk-per-trade CANNOT bind for any legal config (ratio ≥2 structurally); acted>0 = the algebra changed |
| `sizer.live_margin` (γ/α) | `capital/position_sizer.py:298-307` — the live-margin branch (rides the existing `position_sizer.live_margin_used` log event :307 — extend, not duplicate) | **IA-P3-02** / FIX-072: `broker_adapter` never passed by main.py — branch unreachable until wired |
| `risk.sector_cap_bound` (γ) | `capital/risk_engine.py:618` — `projected > self._max_sector_pct * snap.total` branch (observe-log :628-637 / enforce :622 — the BRANCH is the one point, both modes counted) | **IA-P3-05**: the cap cannot be approached at current sizing — the soak is structurally eventless; acted>0 = the soak finally has evidence |
| `risk.daily_loss_gate` (γ) | `capital/risk_engine.py:605-607` — the enforced-reject branch (`return reject(` on breach) | **IA-P6-06**: 0 ever (E4: worst day −₹107 vs ≈₹296 limit) |
| `fm.daily_loss_post_trade` (γ) | `capital/fund_manager.py:1314` `self._on_loss_breach()` | FM7's post-trade half of the DUAL mechanism (memory `dual_daily_loss_mechanism` — same limit, two enforcement points, both registered separately BY NAME) |
| `fm.invariant_violation` | `capital/fund_manager.py:2310` `_handle_invariant_violation` | IA-P6-06: 0 ever |
| `fm.bucket_overflow` | `capital/fund_manager.py:1438` — the H-1 overflow branch | IA-P6-06: 0 ever |
| `fm.commit_hard_kill` | `capital/fund_manager.py:982` — BL-4 `kill_switch.hard_kill(` from `commit_to_used` | IA-P6-06: 0 ever |
| `drift.soft_rung` | `capital/drift_handler.py:236` `soft_kill(` enactment | K-ladder: NEVER fired (28-Jul); single-sample rung |
| `drift.hard_rung` | `capital/drift_handler.py:231` `hard_kill(` enactment | same — HARD has never fired anywhere (Q4 record) |
| `scorer.tier_high` (γ) | `screening/quality_scorer.py:113` `tier = "HIGH"` branch | **IA-P2-03**: HIGH unreachable (threshold 80 > achievable ceiling 65) |
| `scorer.score_gt_ceiling` (γ) | `screening/quality_scorer.py:121` — observation `score > 65` at result return | **G2 tripwire**: >65 is algebraically impossible while 25 pts are dead-at-0 + 20 pinned-at-half; acted>0 = the dead inputs came alive (G2 moved) — the census notices the fix before anyone reports it |
| `placer.emergency_exit` **[ADDED B-2, approved]** | `orders/order_placer.py:3849` `_emergency_market_exit` body | FIX-148/181 last-line exit — **0 executions ever** (audit P5.2 census); acted>0 = the never-fired emergency path finally ran — exactly what this census exists to watch |
| `cnc_gtt_placer` | `orders/cnc_gtt.py:94` `place_for_fill` | delivery OFF (`delivery_enabled: false`); acted>0 BEFORE the 4-Aug flip = an alarm. ⭐ **FLIP-RIDER: the 4-Aug deploy carries the registry edit → event-driven** (GATE-Q7) |
| `cnc_gtt_monitor` | `orders/cnc_gtt_monitor.py:101` `reconcile` — count += len(actions) | same flip-rider |

### A2.4 — The zero-trade-day rule (stated once, applies to the money-path ACTIVE units)

On a genuinely tradeless day, `signal_processor` / `order_placer` / `limit_protocol` /
`order_monitor` / `order_reconciler` legitimately read acted-0 and WILL appear in
MISMATCH(i). **That line is truthful — "nothing acted today" is exactly G9's question
being answered daily — and it is NOT reclassified away.** (GATE-Q3 offers Rama the
alternative; recommendation is to keep it.)

---

## A3 — THE REGISTRY (C2/C6)

Frozen as **`config/expected_managers.yaml`** in this commit. Design decisions embedded
in it (each a GATE question below):

- **Six states**, not two: `expected-active` · `expected-dormant` (reason mandatory) ·
  `expected-event-driven` · `expected-absent` (reason mandatory) · `infra` ·
  `covered-existing`. The card named two; γ anchors, rare-event components and pure
  plumbing do not fit two states without manufacturing daily false mismatches — the
  exact IA-P9-02 disease this item exists to fight.
- **Mismatch classes the census emits:** (i) expected-active & acted==0 · (ii)
  expected-dormant & acted>0 · (iii) expected-absent but CONSTRUCTED · (iv) constructed
  but UNREGISTERED (B2's echo). `infra`/`covered-existing`/`event-driven` never enter
  the mismatch block.
- **expected-dormant carries the reason AND the register ID** — "dormant-by-decision"
  and "dormant-by-registered-finding" are both encoded in `reason:`; what matters
  operationally is identical (acted>0 must surface).
- **Mode-conditionality is IN the registry** (`modes:` field): `clock_skew_probe` is
  live-only BY DESIGN — not a parity break, a registry fact.
- **Flip-riders:** `cnc_gtt_placer`/`cnc_gtt_monitor` flip dormant→event-driven **in the
  same deploy as the 4-Aug flag flip** — the registry edit rides the behaviour change it
  describes (same-carrier rule).

## A4 — THE EOD EMIT POINT (and why it cannot be the 16:05 report)

**Measured:** `daily_report` is a **cron, 16:05, out-of-process**
(`deploy/cron/trading-system.cron:109`) — it can never see in-process counters. The
census therefore emits **in-process, at `_shutdown()` entry — `main.py:1236`**, invoked
from the single convergence point `main.py:~3681` (`_shutdown_event.wait()` →
`_shutdown(...)`). Every clean stop converges there: the FIX-189 17:35 self-exit
(`_start_eod_self_exit_thread` :1097, event set :1210), SIGTERM/Ctrl-C (:1266), manual
`systemctl stop`. ⇒ census emitted **before** manager teardown (counters warm), on
**every clean stop** (a mid-day manual stop emits a partial-day census labeled by its
emit timestamp), **identically in paper and live**. Emission = stable-ordered structured
log lines + the MISMATCH block via the existing logger (grep-able, ships with the
existing log pipeline; exact artifact form is a Phase B decision inside this constraint).
**A crash day produces no census — by design here; the census heartbeat is B5, explicitly
deferred.**

---

## THE GATE — questions for Rama (approve/adjust; Phase B starts only after this)

| # | question | recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1** | Registry states beyond the card's two: `event-driven` + `infra` + `covered-existing` added | **Approve** — two states manufacture daily false mismatches |
| **Q2** | γ sub-units at branch level (12 named above, ALL from the card's own anchor list, none invented) | **Approve** — γ is invisible at manager level by definition |
| **Q3** | Zero-trade-day: money-path ACTIVE units mismatch truthfully on tradeless days | **Keep ACTIVE** (the mismatch is information); alternative: event-driven |
| **Q4** | `signal_processor` counts the `:1230` main path only; resume-path sites `:1995`/`:2272` excluded-and-documented (unreachable today; awakening caught by `entry_gate`/retest units) | **Approve** — one effect-point honestly beats three sites two of which are dead |
| **Q5** | Census hook = `_shutdown()` entry (16:05 report is out-of-process — measured, not assumed) | **Approve** |
| **Q6** | `webhook_receiver` covered-existing via `webhook_audit`; `telegram_notifier` = infra (its `_audit_send` trail exists; alert-truth is ledger #9's scope, not #1's) | **Approve** |
| **Q7** | Flip-rider rule: the 4-Aug flip deploy carries the `cnc_gtt_*` registry edits | **Approve** — else Wednesday's census mismatches by design |

## §AMENDMENTS

**AMENDMENT B-2 — 01-Aug-2026 late (executed 01-Aug ~18:2x IST) — APPROVED VIA THE GATE
(Rama relayed; ChatGPT concurred: "update the frozen contract and registry to match the
measured code, then implement the corrected effect-point"). Never a silent edit; the
superseded text is quoted here in full.**

- **What was wrong:** the original A2.1 `order_placer` row read: *effect-point
  "`orders/order_placer.py:3914` — THE single adapter chokepoint
  `self._adapter.place_order(` (audit P4: one placement pipeline; only call site in the
  module)", acted = "an order dispatched to the broker"*. **Measured during Phase B:
  :3914 sits inside `_emergency_market_exit` (:3849) — the FIX-148/181 emergency path,
  0 executions ever (audit P5.2)** — instrumenting it as expected-active would have
  manufactured a permanent false MISMATCH(i).
- **The Phase-A error class, recorded so the census design never re-absorbs it:** a
  FILE-scoped grep ("only call site in the module") was read as a SYSTEM fact, and the
  audit's "one placement pipeline / one broker chokepoint" (which is about the ADAPTER
  being the chokepoint) was over-read to mean one call line. Repo-wide, the
  `adapter.place_order()` sites disperse: `order_protocol_limit.py:204/:375/:459/:573`,
  `order_protocol_co.py:116/:193`, `eod_squareoff.py` ×3, the reconciler's G5b direct
  call, and the placer's emergency :3914. ⇒ **rule: an effect-point's "single
  chokepoint" claim must be established repo-wide, never file-wide** (same lesson as
  memory `feedback_absence_needs_wide_check`).
- **What changed:** (a) `order_placer` effect-point → `place()` (single public
  placement entry; acted = an entry-placement request executed; state and the
  zero-trade-day caveat unchanged); (b) NEW A2.3 dormant tripwire
  `placer.emergency_exit` at `_emergency_market_exit` :3849; (c) the registry's
  `ohlc_fetchers` descriptive string corrected ×4→×5 (the 5th ctor sits in the flag-OFF
  retest block) — the approved edit it was waiting for. Registry and code amended in
  the same commit as this note.

**AMENDMENT B-2a — 02-Aug-2026 (ledger #2b, docs-only) — RECORD ONLY: the B-2 dispersal
list was itself incomplete, and this completes it by MEASUREMENT. ⛔ NO effect-point
change, NO registry change, NO code change follows from this note.**

- **Why it is here:** B-2's own lesson was *"a single-chokepoint claim must be established
  repo-wide, never file-wide"*. Its dispersal list was written from recall and reproduces
  the very error class it names — so the error-class ledger was left incomplete. The
  ledger-#2 build record (`buyday_filter_build_01aug2026.md` §2) opened this by noting
  *"the B-2 amendment's `place_order()` dispersal list missed kill_switch's own two
  adapter calls (:1549/:1609)"*. **That correction was itself short by one.**
- **The measurement (02-Aug, HEAD `99ca2eb`). SEARCH WIDTH, stated:**
  `grep -rn "\.place_order(" --include=*.py .` over the whole repo, then excluding
  `tests/`, `venv/` (the kiteconnect SDK), and the adapter's own `def place_order`.
  **19 in-service `adapter.place_order()` call sites across 8 modules:**

  | module | sites (HEAD line nos.) | in B-2's list? |
  |---|---|---|
  | `orders/order_protocol_limit.py` | :211 · :382 · :466 · :580 | ✅ all 4 |
  | `orders/order_protocol_co.py` | :123 · :200 | ✅ both |
  | `orders/eod_squareoff.py` | :1293 · :1543 · :1656 | ✅ (named as "×3") |
  | `orders/order_placer.py` | :3928 (`_emergency_market_exit`) | ✅ — the A2.3 dormant tripwire |
  | `capital/kill_switch.py` | :1629 local pass · :1708 broker sweep · **:1789 retry loop** | ❌ **all 3 missed** |
  | `orders/order_reconciler.py` | :1938 · :2188 · :2857 · :3066 | ⚠️ **1 of 4** ("the reconciler's G5b direct call") |
  | `orders/sl_breach_monitor.py` | :221 | ❌ missed |
  | `orders/structure_exit_manager.py` | :445 | ❌ missed |

  (`scripts/t2_cnc_gtt_realtest.py` ×4 is an operator script, not the service — excluded
  from the count, named so the exclusion is a decision and not an oversight.)
- **The kill_switch detail the #2 record owed, corrected:** the record named **two**
  sites; there are **three**. At the then-deployed `297b587` they were :1540 · :1600 ·
  **:1681** (the record's ":1549/:1609" carries the same +9 line-shift its §1 documents);
  at HEAD they are :1629 · :1708 · **:1789**. The third is the **retry pass** inside
  `_exit_all_trades_indestructible` — a fourth sell-under-kill line, on the same
  `intent`-carrying path as :1629. ⭐ Q4 note: it is **already product-correct** — it
  re-fires with the `intent` its first pass derived, and after ledger #2 a CNC row never
  reaches the retry list, because it is spared before the first attempt. Nothing owed.
- **Why NO effect-point moves:** kill-flatten sells go through the adapter **directly**,
  by design; the telemetry counts `placer.place()` — entry-placement requests — on
  purpose, and the reconciler is counted at its own effect-point (`reconcile_once`
  return, actions enacted), not per order. Counting these sites would double-count and
  change what the counter MEANS. The list above is an accuracy record of where the
  capability lives, nothing more.

**Phase B constraints restated (binding, from the card):** counter = pre-allocated handle,
single integer add, no dict-miss, no allocation, no logging, cannot raise (C4) · B2
assertion fail-fast in dev/paper, **CRITICAL-and-continue in live** · stable census order
(C5) · counters reset per trading day · NO new DB table · no behaviour change · one
commit, revert-clean · validation is composition-truth in BOTH modes, never
unit-construct (IA-XTEST-01) · ⛔ no push before 18:15 · deploy only with the book flat
(Rama flattens manually).
