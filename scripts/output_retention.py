# scripts/output_retention.py  --  keep-N reaper for reports/output/ and logs/.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: reports/output/ had NO retention at all -- it grew unbounded,
# and the ops_dashboard says so in as many words ("reports/output has NO
# retention -- grows unbounded"). logs/ was on a 30-day mtime cron that does not
# match every family in it.
#
# WHY COUNT-BASED AND NOT `-mtime +N`  (this is the whole design decision):
#   The retention unit is SEVEN TRADING DAYS, not seven calendar days. An mtime
#   rule cannot express that. `-mtime +7` spans a weekend and keeps ~5 trading
#   days; across a long weekend or a holiday cluster it keeps fewer still. It
#   UNDER-RETAINS, silently, and by a margin that varies with the calendar.
#
#   These producers only write on trading days, so "the newest 7 files" IS
#   "7 trading days" -- by construction, with no calendar arithmetic and no
#   holiday table to keep current. Same shape as backup_retention.py's keep-N.
#
#   Ranking is on the DATE IN THE FILENAME, never mtime. mtime lies here:
#   alert_watcher_2026-07-28.log carried an mtime of 01-Aug, and
#   alert_watcher_2026-08-01.log carried 18-Aug -- an mtime sort would have
#   ordered those two files wrongly against their own content.
#
# POLICY (per family; a family = one glob):
#     KEEP  -- sort by filename date DESCENDING, retain the newest
#              KEEP_PER_FAMILY (7), delete the rest. Each family is counted
#              INDEPENDENTLY; families are never pooled.
#     FLOOR -- structural: keep-N cannot take a family below N, so the
#              emptying case is impossible by construction rather than by a
#              separate guard.
#     CAP   -- if a run would delete more than --max-delete (default 25) files
#              it ABORTS and deletes NOTHING. Steady state is ~6 files/day, so
#              25 is ~4x headroom; a backlog clear needs an explicit override.
#
# SCOPE IS CLOSED, AND DELIBERATELY SO:
#   reports/output/  daily_report_*, daily_trade_review_report_*
#   logs/            system_*, debug_*, trades_*, reconciler_*, alert_watcher_*
#
#   NEVER TOUCHED (excluded by NAME):
#     reports/output/.gitkeep   -- GIT-TRACKED. Deleting it dirties the deployed
#                                  tree, and checkout -f restores it anyway.
#     logs/.holiday_notified_*  -- state markers, not output.
#     logs/cron-*.log           -- append-mode, undated: unrankable by date and
#                                  mismatched by any mtime rule.
#
#   A file in a scope dir that matches no family, or that matches a family but
#   carries NO PARSEABLE DATE, is REFUSED and logged -- never deleted. An
#   unrankable file must not be allowed to displace a real one from the keep set.
#
# OUT OF SCOPE ON PURPOSE -- DO NOT ADD THESE:
#   data_store/backups/    -- restore depth, owned by backup_retention.py
#                             (keep 20 pre_* / 14 daily / 14 analytics).
#   data_store/v3/*.jsonl  -- append-only and UNREGENERABLE; read IN FULL by
#                             v3_shadow_soak_report.py. Never delete.
#   data_store/evidence/*.jsonl -- Batch 1 forward evidence contract. Append-only
#                             and UNREGENERABLE BY CONSTRUCTION: the contract
#                             forbids backfill, so a deleted day cannot be
#                             recreated from any later state. Never delete.
#                             (Backed up separately by scripts/backup_evidence.py --
#                             a SAME-DISK copy: it protects against accidental
#                             deletion or corruption of the primary file, NOT
#                             against loss of the disk or the machine; nothing in
#                             this system copies any artefact off the box. And
#                             excluded-from-pruning is NOT backed-up.)
#   data_store/candles/, t2_proof_*/, control_tower/, cron_marks/,
#   security_state.json.
#
# WHAT SURVIVES DELETION: both xlsx families rebuild from the DB --
# daily_trade_review is DB-pure by its own guardrail, daily_report is
# DB-derivable via config_snapshots. EXCEPT daily_report_2026-06-19 ..
# 2026-07-01, which PREDATE config_snapshots (first row 2026-07-02); those were
# archived to reports/archive_prereconstruct/ and are outside this scope.
# THE LOGS DO NOT REBUILD -- nothing regenerates a deleted log file.
#
# SAFETY: dry-run BY DEFAULT (--apply to delete) - realpath-asserted inside the
# owning scope dir - symlinks refused - never raises into cron, and records a
# heartbeat on BOTH the success and failure paths (monitored: true).
