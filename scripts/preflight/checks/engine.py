"""
scripts/preflight/checks/engine.py -- Group 8 (Engine readiness), Phase B.

Phase B runs at 09:14, by which time token-watcher has started the app. Pre-flight
is a SEPARATE process, so it cannot introspect the app's in-memory engine objects
directly -- it attests readiness via the app's own surfaces:
  * trading-system.service active (process up)               -> services group
  * GET :8080/health  -> 200/healthy (db + token + kill_switch, FIX-188)
  * GET :8080/metrics -> 200 (signal pipeline queryable; surfaces signals/positions)
  * fund_manager free cash sane (no NaN -- crash-test FIX). 25-Jul-2026: sourced
    live from fm_ledger + trades; capital_snapshot has 0 rows and is retired.
  * capital deployment % (alert-only, WARN; observability, never a gate)

Per-engine introspection (signal_processor / risk_engine / live_feed / shadow_tracker
threads individually) would need an app-side /readyz; not built -- /health + /metrics
are the externally-observable proxy. App DOWN at Phase B is CRITICAL (token-watcher's
job, not pre-flight's -- alert-only, never auto-started here).

class CapitalDeploymentCheck(Check):
    """How much of today's capital is deployed: margin_used / total_capital.

    NEW and SEPARATE on purpose (25-Jul-2026). It would have been cheaper to hang
    this off FundManagerBalanceCheck, but that check answers "is free cash sane?"
    and a CRITICAL from it must keep meaning exactly that. Overloading it would
    make one signal carry two questions, and the deployment % is an observability
    number, not a readiness gate.

    Hence ALERT-ONLY: criticality WARN, so an unusual deployment level is reported
    and can never escalate the run to CRITICAL.

    ⭐ DEFINITION (new, dated): capital_deployed_pct = margin_used / total_capital,
    where total_capital is the day's opening capital (first INIT row) and
    margin_used is margin on OPEN positions. The previous definition, in
    healthcheck_server.py, was margin_used / cash_floor -- a ratio against the
    REMAINING cash rather than the total, which grows without bound as the book
    fills. It never emitted a value in production (capital_snapshot has 0 rows),
    so no series and no consumer holds the old meaning.

    FIX 2 (10-Aug-2026) -- IT HAD NO PREDICATE AT ALL. Every reachable path
    below the div-0 guard returned _passed(), for any value. On 10-Aug it
    printed "capital deployed 432.3%" and PASSED, on the same boot the capital
    invariant hard-killed. A missing check leaves you uncertain; a tautological
    one leaves you WRONGLY certain.

    WHAT 432.3% ACTUALLY IS, and why no threshold was invented for it:
    `opening` is the INIT row's balance_after, which fund_manager.initialize()
    writes as broker CASH. `margin_used` sums trades.margin_reserved over
    OPEN/PARTIAL/EXITING -- which, for a carried delivery position, is money the
    broker has ALREADY converted into a holding and removed from that cash.
    Numerator and denominator therefore sit on DIFFERENT BASES, and 432.3% is
    that mismatch printed as a number, not a deployment level.

    So the predicate is the bound the system ALREADY ENFORCES, not a new risk
    appetite: every reservation is made against a bucket, the buckets partition
    the same total (intraday_bucket_pct + positional_bucket_pct = 1.0), and
    _check_invariant holds avail+reserved+used == cash_floor with all four
    non-negative. Deployed margin can therefore NEVER exceed the capital it was
    reserved from. `used > opening` is reachable ONLY when `used` counts a
    position whose money is not in `opening` -- i.e. a carry. NO NUMBER IS
    INVENTED HERE: the bound is 100%, and 100% is the sum of the split.

    Still Criticality.WARN, deliberately: the 25-Jul ruling above stands
    unchanged. This can report, and can never escalate a run to CRITICAL or
    block trading. What changes is only that it CAN now be non-green.

    NOT ADDRESSED HERE, and named rather than silently left: the printed
    percentage still has a cash denominator, so it under-states the account
    whenever a delivery position is carried. Correcting the base means
    re-deriving Fix 1's carry rule inside preflight -- a SECOND site for one
    semantic, which is the defect Fix 1 removed -- and it would need a product
    split that trades cannot answer (there is no trades.product column; it lives
    on orders via ENTRY-leg join, and a missing ENTRY row reads NULL). The
    operands are printed with their bases instead, so the number is never read
    as something it is not.
