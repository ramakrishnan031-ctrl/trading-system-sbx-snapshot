"""
scripts/healthcheck_server.py -- Trading System v2  FIX-132 Item 15

Purpose:
    Lightweight HTTP health endpoint for external uptime monitoring.
    Runs on port 8080 (separate from webhook port 5000).

Locked Design Decisions:
    HC1  -- GET /health returns JSON: {status, uptime_seconds, trades_today, timestamp}.
    HC2  -- Runs in a daemon thread started from main.py at boot.
    HC3  -- Uses waitress (already in requirements) for production WSGI.
    HC4  -- trades_today queries state_store for today's CLOSED+OPEN trade count.
    HC5  -- uptime_seconds computed from process start time.
    HC6  -- Graceful: daemon thread dies on process exit; no explicit stop needed.
