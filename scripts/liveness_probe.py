scripts/liveness_probe.py -- Trading System v2  (17-Jul-2026, liveness alarm)

Alarms when `trading-system.service` is UNEXPECTEDLY DOWN during the hours it must be up.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    On 17-Jul-2026 the S4 boot fix halted the service at 08:16:09 with a CLEAN exit 0
    (a failed /health self-check fired _shutdown_event). It took 0 trades on a live
    trading day -- and NOTHING noticed for the whole session:
      * monitoring_canary's respawn probe watches `alert-watcher.service`, not this one;
      * its dashboard probe watches `gui-dashboard`, not this one;
      * `Restart=on-failure` + a clean exit 0 means systemd never restarts and never
        complains, so NRestarts stays 0 -- the *healthy* value.
    Nothing has ever watched trading-system's LIVENESS. A headless system that can die
    silently is the gap this closes. See docs/audit/s4_boot_outage_17jul2026.md.

WHAT IT DOES
    Every 5 minutes across the window, on trading days only: if the unit is not active
    and the operator did not park it, raise ONE CRITICAL (Telegram; CRITICAL sentinel
    fallback, exactly as the canary does).

INDEPENDENCE (deliberate)
    This probe must not depend on the health of the thing it monitors. It does NOT import
    main.py: if main.py could not be imported, the probe would die exactly when the system
    is broken -- which is the silent failure it exists to prevent. The window constants are
    therefore duplicated here, and test_liveness_probe.py::
    test_window_end_not_after_a_legitimate_exit asserts this probe's upper bound never
    passes the configured service stop time. Drift is caught by the suite, not paid for at
    runtime.

THE FALSE-ALARM MATRIX (this is the whole design -- see the report for the derivation)
    SILENT  non-trading day (weekend / NSE holiday)   -- authoritative calendar (S1)
    SILENT  outside [09:00, 16:00) IST                -- it is not expected up yet / any more
    SILENT  unit is active                            -- healthy
    SILENT  operator SOFT_KILL / HARD_KILL parked it  -- a deliberate, recorded halt
    SILENT  already alarmed for this same incident    -- dedup on InactiveEnterTimestamp
    ALARM   anything else                             -- an unexpected death

    *** A deliberate `systemctl stop` is NOT distinguishable from a silent death. ***
    Both leave Result=success / ExecMainStatus=0 -- today's outage was itself a clean
    exit 0. So an unmarked stop ALARMS, by design: a missed real death costs a trading
    session, a false alarm costs a Telegram message. The operator already has the
    documented way to say "this is intentional" -- park it with a SOFT_KILL (as the
    16-Jul planned pause did: reason="planned pause ... no trading issue", by=operator),
    which this probe honours.

Exit codes: 0 = probed (alarmed or not); 1 = the probe itself could not run.

# ── The liveness window ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# UPPER BOUND 16:00. main._eod_self_exit_due() returns (False, -1) *without querying*
# before its window_end, so the service NEVER self-exits before the configured stop time
# -- at 15:59 it must still be up.
#
# ⚠️ 25-Jul-2026: the service stop time became CONFIGURABLE and is now 17:35, so this
# bound is CONSERVATIVE rather than exact -- it no longer equals the stop time, it is
# merely never after it (which is the property that matters: never alarm during a period
# when a clean exit is already legitimate).
#
# ⛔ Do NOT "resync" this to 17:35. This probe's cron is `*/5 09-15 Mon-Fri` (last run
# 15:55) and structurally cannot run past 16:00; raising the constant alone would
# advertise a window the probe never visits AND would alarm every day after the 17:35
# exit. The 16:00-17:35 tail is genuinely UNWATCHED -- a recorded, triggered follow-up
# (docs/audit/service_window_configurable_25jul2026.md §6), and extending it needs the
# cron AND this bound moved together, which is its own small design.
#
# LOWER BOUND is deliberately NOT main.SERVICE_WINDOW_START (08:00). 08:00 is when the
# service MAY start, not when it MUST be up: the 08:15 token cron -> token-watcher ->

# there would be a guaranteed daily false alarm. 09:00 is after every legitimate start
# path and still 15 minutes before the 09:15 market open -- today's 08:16:09 death would
# have been caught at 09:00, a full hour before the 10:00 entry window.
