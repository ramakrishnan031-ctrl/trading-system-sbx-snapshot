"""
tests/integration/test_q9_live_seed_mc1_wired.py — the LIVE capital seed (M-C1), wired.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Every wired test in the Q9 programme (batches 1-5) ran with the
`wired_system` fixture, which is `paper_mode=True`. Production runs `main.py --mode live`. The
programme's parity claim was STRUCTURAL — one shared restore path, only the seed differs — and
that argument is sound, but it stops exactly where the two modes genuinely diverge: THE SEED.

    PAPER seed  main.py:2243   selected_account.paper_capital        static; excludes today's P&L
    LIVE  seed  main.py:2255   broker.get_margins().net
                               - fund_manager.today_realized_pnl_carryover()      <-- M-C1

WHY THE SUBTRACTION EXISTS. On a mid-day warm restart the broker's `net` ALREADY includes today's
realized P&L, and rehydrate Phase 2 (fund_manager.py:1703-1711) then RE-ADDS it
(`bucket avail += pnl`, `_total += pnl`). Without the subtraction today's P&L is counted TWICE
and live reservable capital silently INFLATES — the system would trade on capital it does not
have. Measured here: without it, `_total` lands 18,094.54 above `broker.net`, exactly the
carryover.

🔴 SAFETY — THIS FILE CANNOT REACH A REAL BROKER, BY CONSTRUCTION.
"Live mode" here means the live SEEDING ARITHMETIC, never a live BROKER CONNECTION. There is no
live-mode fixture: the only thing the live seed needs from a broker is one number, so this file
uses `_StubBroker`, a local object whose `get_margins()` returns a value the test chooses. No
adapter is constructed, no credentials are read, `kiteconnect` is never imported.
`TestNoBrokerReachable` pins that for the whole test tree.

⭐ §A4 — WHAT EXECUTES, AND WHAT IS REPLICATED (rule F, stated honestly; the trap that has
fired three times running — batch 4 twice, batch 5's reused KillSwitch).

  REAL production code, driven by these tests:
      fund_manager.today_realized_pnl_carryover()        :1777   the live-seed subtrahend
      fund_manager._today_release_used_pnl_rows()        :1757   the SHARED row selection
      fund_manager.initialize(seed)                      :408    main.py:2259
      fund_manager.rehydrate_from_open_trades()          :1626   main.py:2286, Phase 2

  NOW CALLED DIRECTLY (B1 extraction, 21-Jul-2026): the seed arithmetic was moved from an
      inline expression in main()'s body into a module-level function `main.compute_live_seed`,
      so `_live_seed()` below invokes the REAL production expression instead of replicating it.
      The whole-file regex pin
      (test_q9_post_restart_capital_wired.TestParity::test_the_live_seed_still_subtracts_the_carryover)
      is kept as a cheap structural backstop — it still fails if the subtraction is removed or the
      two sides stop sharing the row helper — but the behaviour is now covered directly.

  ⇒ These tests prove the MECHANISM — that the subtrahend is exactly what Phase 2 re-adds, so the
    seed cancels to broker.net. That is the part that can silently break. The arithmetic that
    consumes it is two lines under a regex pin. RUNTIME-PROVEN, not assumed:
    `_today_release_used_pnl_rows` CALL COUNT == 2 (once per side), asserted below.

⚠️ §A2 — THE CANCELLATION IS CONTRACT-INDEPENDENT, SO IT SURVIVES E4/W10.
Both sides sum `pnl_delta` from the SAME helper, so `net - Σ + Σ == net` holds whatever
`pnl_delta` means. If either side ever computes its rows independently the cancellation breaks
SILENTLY, with neither number looking wrong on its own — the same shape as E4/W10 itself.
TestSharedHelper pins it.

  ⚠️ CORRECTED 20-Jul-2026 — §A2 as originally written contained a FALSE claim, and it is
  removed here rather than left to be re-read as fact. It said the daily-loss reader "is not
  involved in the cancellation at all" / "the seed and Phase 2 never consult it".
  **That is false:** `rehydrate_from_open_trades` calls `get_daily_realized_net_pnl` at
  fund_manager.py:1736. The true claim is narrower — the value is read AFTER Phase 2 and AFTER
  the invariant check, and is used ONLY as a log field. Shared code path; no causal dependency.
  §A2 also leaned on the reader being a *numerically different* quantity (the observed
  reader=-18,189.08 vs carryover=-18,094.54, differing by exactly Σcosts). That difference was a
  CONSEQUENCE of the old contract, never the REASON for independence — post-E4/W10 the two are
  equal during the session and differ only after the EOD reset.
  The conclusion (the cancellation survives E4/W10) STANDS, on three structural reasons set out
  in TestSharedHelper's docstring and in
  docs/audit/mc1_live_seed_rederivation_20jul2026.md (verdict: STILL SOUND, NEW REASON).

    claim "the reader is not involved". The two were never equivalent: the gap was merely a
    CONSEQUENCE of the old contract (it equalled Σcosts). E4/W10 makes the two equal during the
    session, so the proxy fired on a merge that changed nothing about the mechanism — and it
    would have stayed silent had the mechanism broken while the numbers happened to differ.
    **A test that pins a symptom rather than the property fails on changes that do not threaten
    it and stays silent on changes that do. Both halves are bad.**

    (A naive inversion to `reader == carryover` would have been wrong too: post-E4/W10 the two
    are equal DURING the session but differ AFTER the EOD reset, because the reader has no
    entry_type filter and therefore sees RESET_PNL. It was a transient coincidence either way.)

    The three tests below pin the three STRUCTURAL reasons the cancellation is contract-
    independent, and all three pass identically before and after E4/W10:
      1. both sides draw the same rows/field from ONE shared helper ⇒ (net-Σ)+Σ = net for any
         meaning of `pnl_delta`            → test_both_sides_still_call_the_shared_helper
                                             + test_the_carryover_equals_exactly_what_phase_2…
      2. the ONLY reader-derived ledger row (RESET_PNL) is excluded by the helper's
         entry_type filter                 → test_the_reset_pnl_row_cannot_reach_the_cancellation
      3. the one reader call on the path is a log field
                                           → test_the_rehydrate_reader_call_is_observational_only

    FALSIFICATION CONDITIONS (the original argument had none — which is why it survived until a
    merge broke it):
      #1 the two sides cease to share `_today_release_used_pnl_rows`  (pinned: tests 1)
      #2 ⭐ that helper's `entry_type='RELEASE_USED'` filter is dropped or widened to admit
         RESET_PNL — THE LOAD-BEARING ONE                              (pinned: test 2)
      #3 rehydrate_from_open_trades:1736 ceases to be log-only         (pinned: test 3)
      #4 the seed and rehydrate derive their own day-floors and can straddle midnight —
         pre-existing, contract-independent, NOT pinned here. See
