tests/integration/test_q9_capital_invariant_wired.py — Q9 batch 3, item (C).

THE CAPITAL INVARIANT, ASSERTED AT EVERY LIFECYCLE STAGE ON THE WIRED PATH.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Q4 established that money writes here are SINGLE-WRITER and correct at
the COLUMN level (`fm_ledger` written only at fund_manager.py:2365; `trades.gross_pnl/charges/
net_pnl` only at state_store.py:2268). The residual risk is therefore not a bad write but a bad
VALUE — every part individually right, only the RELATIONSHIP between them wrong. No
column-level or single-function test can catch that shape, and this file is the catcher.

THE LIVE PROOF THAT THE SHAPE EXISTS — E4/W10:
    WRITER  fund_manager.release_used stores pnl_delta = gross - costs   (ALREADY NET)
    READER  state_store.get_daily_realized_net_pnl = SUM(pnl_delta) - SUM(costs)
    => costs subtracted TWICE; the daily loss limit fires EARLY on an overstated loss.
Fixed on branch `e4-w10-pnl-contract`@`ad34ee4`, deliberately UNPUSHED pending Rama's
risk-posture sign-off (it changes WHEN the loss limit fires). This file DOCUMENTS that bug in
executable form; it does NOT fix it.

⚠️ THE INVARIANT THAT ACTUALLY HOLDS (verified against real code + runtime, not assumed):

  I1 (GLOBAL, holds):  (intraday+positional) available + reserved + used == fund_manager._total
      This is what production itself asserts — fund_manager.py:2268 calls
      assert_capital_invariant(cash_floor=_total, realized_pnl_today=0.0), i.e. rhs == _total,
      because fund_manager tracks _total directly (docstring :2209).

  I1-per-bucket (DOES **NOT** HOLD — do not assert it):  fund_manager.py:2235 guards the
      per-bucket checks behind "only when a partition is already negative", and its comment
      states that a legitimate PnL-shifted per-bucket split (avail+reserved+used != total*pct)
      is never reached. Asserting the identity per bucket would be WRONG.

  I2 (holds):  _total - starting_capital == realized net P&L (ground truth). Note _total moves
      by the FULL P&L including profits (runtime-verified: a winner raised it by exactly the
      net). P7a's `cash_floor + min(0, realized)` form in capital/invariant.py:89 is a
      DIFFERENT quantity — the tradable balance, where profits are withheld until T+1
      settlement. The two are not interchangeable; do not conflate them.

  I5 (the CONTRACT invariant — FALSE TODAY, by E4/W10): reader == independent ground truth.
      See TestContractInvariant below for the design and why it is a strict xfail.

INDEPENDENT GROUND TRUTH (§A3). Realized net P&L is recomputed from TRADE-level data —
`SUM(trades.net_pnl)` — which is a DIFFERENT table, written by a DIFFERENT path
(state_store.py:2268 on close) from the one the reader aggregates (`fm_ledger`, written by
fund_manager.release_used). Two computations sharing a source cannot cross-check each other;
these do not share one.

SCENARIO HAZARDS designed around (§A5, rule G):
  * The post-close daily-loss breach is NOT passive — _make_daily_loss_cb (main.py:757-800)
    force-closes positions via EOD fire_now and arms a soft kill. The fixture's limit is
    2% x 500,000 = 10,000; every scenario here stays far below it, and the tests ASSERT the
    kill never armed so a future sizing change cannot silently wreck the capital picture.
  * max_consecutive_losses=4 is checked before DAILY_LOSS in RE5 — irrelevant here (no
    scenario drives 4 losses) but noted.
  * The per-strategy cap (signal_processor.py:624-640) fires BEFORE the risk engine, so the
    multi-position case seeds across DIFFERENT strategies (the exact fix batch 2 needed).
  * paper_auto_fill_delay_sec=60 -> an admitted order stays UNFILLED and holds a LIVE
    reservation. The invariant accounts for that rather than being surprised by it.
  * RMS/CHECK1 closes pass costs=0.0; these are ORDINARY SL/TGT closes, costed normally, so
    nothing here depends on the zero-cost path.

PARITY (Rule #5): the capital path is shared, not duplicated per mode. FundManager takes no
mode argument and contains no paper/live branch (grep: no `paper`/`is_paper` in
capital/fund_manager.py); the divergence is downstream in broker/zerodha_adapter.py:348
(paper_mode -> _paper_place_order). So the identity proven here holds identically in live.

    ✅ MIGRATED 20-Jul-2026 — E4/W10 landed, and I5 is now simply TRUE.

    The design below worked exactly as intended and is kept as the record of why:

      I5 was FALSE by the known E4/W10 bug, so it could not be a plain green assertion and must
      not be "fixed" into passing. The pair satisfied four requirements at once:
        1. green then — the suite did not go red on a known, accepted bug (strict xfail);
        2. it could not silently start passing when E4/W10 landed — strict xfail reports an
           XPASS as a FAILURE, forcing a deliberate flip as part of that migration instead of a
           stale test quietly rotting in the suite;
        3. no rewrite needed then, and no hard-coded rupee figure anywhere (rule D);
        4. a NEW discrepancy could not hide behind the old one — the second test asserted,
           plain green, that the delta was EXACTLY the double-counted costs and nothing else.
      Strict xfail was chosen over alternatives (a skip hides it; a plain assertion of current
      buggy behaviour bakes the bug in and would need rewriting; a warning is ignorable).

    ⭐ REQUIREMENT (2) IS THE ONE THAT PAID OFF. On the 20-Jul merge the strict xfail XPASSed
    and was reported as a FAILURE, which stopped that deploy at the regression gate and forced
    this flip to be deliberate. It did its job precisely as designed.

    Requirement (4) survives the migration rather than being dropped: the second test now guards
    the failure mode E4/W10 CREATES — a silent FAIL-OPEN degradation of
    `round_trip_costs_or_zero` to 0.0 would make `reader == truth` hold trivially. See its
    docstring. Full context: docs/audit/e4_w10_deploy_20jul2026.md.
