"""
tests/unit/test_schema_version_failfast.py — fresh-audit §B.1 guard.

`core/state_store.py::_initialize_schema` must REFUSE to open a database whose
stored schema_version is NEWER than EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION, instead of letting
the UNCONDITIONAL executescript() silently stamp the version DOWN (the pre-fix
silent-downgrade: v42 P1 DB opened by v41 code after a code revert booted clean
at v41, stranding the newer schema's tables).

Schema-backed — exercises the real StateStore against the real core/schema.sql,
no mocks (the class of test the 04-Jul audit recommended for raw-SQL paths).

  T1 — newer DB  → fail-fast, stored version NOT mutated   (red→green core)
  T2 — older DB  → still migrates up to EXPECTED           (migrate-up intact)
  T3 — equal/fresh DB → boots + terminal-guard trigger present (brick check)
