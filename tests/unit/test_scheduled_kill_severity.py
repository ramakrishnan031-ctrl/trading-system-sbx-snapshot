"""tests/unit/test_scheduled_kill_severity.py -- SK-B (26-Jul-2026).

A SCHEDULED kill is a normal daily event and must not page like an emergency.

`soft_kill()` sent its HALT alert at CRITICAL unconditionally, so the 15:15 circuit
breaker and the EOD squareoff -- both of which fire on a timer every trading day --
arrived at the same severity as a genuine trading halt. That accounted for 5 of the
CRITICALs in the 82-alert review.

⭐ THE TAXONOMY ALREADY EXISTS AND IS ALREADY TRUSTED FOR MORE.
`SCHEDULED_KILL_REASONS` (kill_switch.py:114) is what `auto_clear_scheduled_kill()`
consults to decide whether a persisted kill SILENTLY CLEARS ITSELF at the next 08:15
boot -- i.e. whether the system resumes trading unattended. Reusing the same predicate
to choose a severity is a strictly SMALLER trust than the one already placed in it.
No new classification was invented.

⚠️ THE THING THAT MUST NOT BREAK: an EMERGENCY kill must stay CRITICAL, because
CRITICAL is the only severity with the email-fallback leg (FIX-191, 23-Jun-2026) --
a WARNING drops silently when Telegram is down. The branch is exact string equality
against a 2-element frozenset, and every emergency caller in the tree passes a reason
that cannot equal either literal:

    main.py:665            f"{source}: {reason}"                 (composite)
    kill_switch.py:775     "Auto-trip: N consecutive API failures ..."
    system_manager.py:913  f"System Manager EOD {day}: ..."      (prefixed)
    cnc_gtt_monitor.py:607 f"cnc_gtt_monitor: {reason}"          (prefixed)
    live_feed.py:303/474/648  LIVEFEED_QUEUE_FULL / _RECONNECT_EXHAUSTED / _CONSUMER_THREAD_DEAD

⭐ AND IT DOES NOT GO QUIET. The alert still SENDS, at WARNING -- it is not
suppressed. Independently, the 15:15 event already carries a dedicated and MORE
informative WARNING from a DIFFERENT module (`main.py:699`, "CIRCUIT BREAKER -- Force
Close ... EOD squareoff closes INTRADAY (MIS/CO) positions at 15:17"; the wording was
"will close all positions" until 03-Aug-2026 -- corrected because EOD6 does not touch
delivery, see test_kill_alerts_delivery_carveout.py), and the kill is still
logged CRITICAL to the log (`kill_switch.py:562`) and persisted to
`kill_switch_state`. So a downgrade here cannot manufacture a silent success.
