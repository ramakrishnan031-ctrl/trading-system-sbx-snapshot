"""tests/unit/test_output_retention.py -- guards for the reports/logs reaper.

This job DELETES. Every test asserts a PROPERTY of the plan (keep-N holds,
ranking ignores mtime, families do not pool, unknown/undated files are refused)
rather than a fixed file count, so the suite still means something if the
window or the family list is retuned.

The load-bearing one is test_ranking_ignores_mtime_and_uses_filename_date: the
original implementation ranked by mtime, which under-retains across weekends and
ordered alert_watcher_2026-07-28.log (mtime 01-Aug) after files that were really
older. That defect is what these tests exist to keep out.

All filesystem work happens inside pytest's tmp_path.
