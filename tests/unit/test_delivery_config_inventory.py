22-Aug-2026 — JOB 1: "fill every empty delivery setting from intraday".

THE SWEEP FOUND NOTHING TO FILL, and this file is what pins that finding so it
cannot silently stop being true.

Why the sweep is closed rather than best-effort: every pydantic model in
core/config_loader.py declares `extra="forbid"`, so the set of *possible* config
keys IS the schema field set. Walking the schema therefore enumerates every
delivery-scoped setting that can exist -- there is no "and maybe some others"
tail. test_extra_forbid_closes_the_key_universe below measures that premise
instead of assuming it.

What this file asserts:

  1. the discovery is NOT vacuous (it finds fields, across files and models)
  2. THE PROPERTY -- every delivery-scoped setting is explicitly written in its
     YAML and is non-null; none is absent, none is supplied silently
  3. the property check CAN go red (a control that deletes a key and expects the
     same checker to report it)
  4. the discovered inventory equals the recorded one -- a NEW delivery-scoped
     key must be added here deliberately, and must be set in the YAML

DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED HERE: any particular number. The two delivery COUNT
caps (max_open_delivery_positions=3, max_daily_delivery_trades=5) are TIGHTER
than their intraday twins (5 and 10) on purpose. Writing the intraday value into
them -- the literal instruction "fill from intraday" -- would have LOOSENED two
live risk limits, 3->5 and 5->10. They were left exactly as they are; their
schema defaults are a separate defect handled as NI-4.
