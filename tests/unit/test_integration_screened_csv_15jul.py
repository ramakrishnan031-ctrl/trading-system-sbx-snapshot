"""Integration test for the 15-Jul COMBINED DEPLOY (`deploy-15jul-combined`).

The merged generate_screened_stocks_csv.py must carry BOTH overlapping change sets:
  - Branch A (M-SC2b): the reads go through a dedicated READ-ONLY connection
    (db_connect.connect_readonly) — no `transaction(readonly=)` TypeError, and the
    connection cannot write.
  - Branch B (F2): `_cron_main` records a FUNCTIONAL status derived from the CSV
    artifact (OK / EMPTY_NO_DATA / FAILED) via `_csv_functional_status`.

This asserts BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY on the merged code, so a merge that dropped either
side fails here.

    # unnoticed — but on the VM that directory holds the LIVE 16:01 artifacts
