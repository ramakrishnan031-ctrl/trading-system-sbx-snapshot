THE TEST THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE ORIGINAL DEFECT.

`reports/daily_report.py:464` classified a rejection as CAPITAL by substring-matching the
free-text `rejection_reason`:

    rejected_capital = sum(1 for s in data.signals
                           if "CAPITAL" in (s.get("rejection_reason") or "").upper())

The CONCENTRATION reason embeds `capital_qty=`, so EVERY concentration rejection matched.
Measured on production data for 2026-07-10: **1,189 rejections reported as CAPITAL when the
true count was 0** -- the report told the operator the system was capital-starved while the
constraint that binds on 100% of trades was never named anywhere he would see it.

The strings below are the REAL ones, copied verbatim from the live database, not invented
approximations. A test built on a tidied-up string would not have caught this.
