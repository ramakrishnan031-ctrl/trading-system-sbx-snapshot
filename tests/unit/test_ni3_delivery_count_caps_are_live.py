NI-3 (22-Aug-2026) — COMMENTS ONLY. No logic changed anywhere for this item.

max_open_delivery_positions and max_daily_delivery_trades carried a clause saying
they did nothing while force_intraday_only coerced every strategy to INTRADAY.
force_intraday_only is FALSE. The clause was a true conditional with a false
antecedent, which reads as "ignore me" -- the same hazard the delivery SIZING
comments carried until fix item 1 removed them.

Three things are pinned here, because a comment fix that only deletes words is
worth nothing if the replacement words are also wrong:

  1. NO SURVIVING CLAIM -- the phrase family is gone from every site that describes
     these two caps. The check is proven able to go red by running the same sweep
     over text that still contains it.
  2. THE ANTECEDENT REALLY IS FALSE in the shipped config. If force_intraday_only
     is ever set back to true, this goes red and the new comments must be revisited
     -- which is the correct outcome, not a nuisance.
  3. THE NEW WORD IS TRUE -- "ENFORCED" is asserted against the code, not just
     written into a comment: a delivery entry at the cap is rejected.
