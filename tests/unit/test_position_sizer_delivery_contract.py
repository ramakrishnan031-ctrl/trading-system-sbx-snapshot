tests/unit/test_position_sizer_delivery_contract.py

22-Aug-2026 (fix item 1) — THIS FILE'S SUBJECT WAS INVERTED, DELIBERATELY.

It used to prove an "INERT delivery-sizing scaffold": that an unset delivery knob
fell back to the global (intraday) value, "byte-identical". That fallback is the
defect this build removes — delivery is live, has traded, and was being sized on
the intraday risk budget through exactly that branch. The three assertions below
that used to demand inheritance now demand REFUSAL.

NI-7 (22-Aug-2026) renamed this file from `..._delivery_scaffold.py` to
`..._delivery_contract.py` — a pure rename, 0 insertions / 0 deletions, md5
unchanged. The earlier note here said the stale "scaffold" name was "recorded, not
silently renamed mid-gate"; that was true only until the gate closed. NI-13 corrects
this docstring, which still named the old path and still claimed the file was kept
under it.
