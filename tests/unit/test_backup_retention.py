"""T2 backup-retention reaper — tests (a DELETION job, so safety is the focus).

Covers ChatGPT's checklist: keep-N selection + newest-preserved, dry-run vs apply,
the sanity cap (+ --max-delete override), scoped-pattern/symlink refusal, and the
locked / missing-file (race) handling. Exercises build_plan()/execute() directly,
so no Telegram/heartbeat side effects.
