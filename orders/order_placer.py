orders/order_placer.py — Trading System v2

Purpose:
    Orchestrates the full order placement lifecycle for a single trade.
    Called by signal_processor with (symbol, side, qty, entry_price,
    sl_price, intent, signal_id, reservation_id). Creates the trade row,
    places all entry orders, starts fill monitoring, and commits (or
    releases) the capital reservation on fill/failure.

Locked Design Decisions:
    OP1  -- place() is the only public method called by signal_processor.
            Signature: place(symbol, side, qty, entry_price, sl_price,
            intent, signal_id, reservation_id) → None.
    OP2  -- place() is synchronous: creates trade, places orders, registers
            with order_monitor, returns. Fill handling is async (event-driven).
    OP3  -- tgt_price computed internally: entry ± (entry-sl)*rr_ratio.
            Default rr_ratio=2.0 (configurable at construction).
            LONG: tgt = entry + (entry - sl) * rr
            SHORT: tgt = entry - (sl - entry) * rr
    OP4  -- trade_id assigned via core.ids.new_trade_id() inside place().
            DB row created before any broker call. On broker failure,
            trade status set to FAILED and capital reservation released.
    OP5  -- In-memory fill map: internal_order_id → {trade_id, reservation_id,
            symbol, qty, leg}. Cleaned up on OrderFilled or FAILED.
    OP6  -- Subscribes to OrderFilled event at construction. Handler:
            commit capital, record fill in DB, update trade status to OPEN.
    OP7  -- On entry placement failure: set trade=FAILED, release reservation,
            cancel any partially placed orders best-effort.
    OP8  -- Thread-safe: _fill_map guarded by threading.Lock.
    OP9  -- order_protocol determined by intent: "INTRADAY" → default_protocol
            (LIMIT_TRIPLE by default; overridable at construction).
            Future: per-strategy config via scanner_configs.
    OP10 -- Sector passed as None (data/symbol_validator not yet built).
    OP11 -- Layer 5 (orders/). Imports orders/, core/, capital/, broker.

Last-Mile Gaps (locked 2026-04-16):
    OP-LM1 -- Kill-switch last-mile check. Immediately before engine.execute(),
              if kill_switch.is_active("entry"): mark trade FAILED, release
              reservation, raise OrderRejectedError("kill_switch_active_last_mile").
              kill_switch injected at construction (optional; None = disabled).
    OP-LM2 -- Reservation release on placement failure. Every BrokerError and
              soft-failure path calls fund_manager.release(reservation_id, reason)
              before returning/raising. Implemented via _handle_placement_failure().
    OP-LM3 -- Empty broker_order_id treated as failure. Validated in protocol
              files (order_protocol_limit.py, order_protocol_co.py) immediately
              after each adapter.place_order() call. Raises OrderRejectedError.
              [REFINED 2026-07-22, doc-only.] "Raises" is the ENTRY/SL rule; an
              empty broker_order_id on the LIMIT_TRIPLE TGT leg now returns a
              partial SL-only result (FIX-190 Bug C), NOT a raise — the SL still
              protects. See locked_decisions.yaml OP-LM3 (per-leg scope) and
              order_protocol_limit.py:485-495.

BL-8 (locked 2026-04-19, Phase C.2):
    OP-BL8a -- _persist_entry_orders is ATOMIC. Uses
               OrderManager.insert_orders_atomic so all ENTRY/SL/TGT INSERTs
               commit together or none do. Pre-BL-8 the helper did three
               separate INSERTs and SWALLOWED any exception ("reconciler
               will rebuild from broker state"). That swallow was the
               silent-failure mode BL-8 closes -- reconciler is a backstop,
               not a primary recovery mechanism.
    OP-BL8b -- _persist_entry_orders now PROPAGATES exceptions. The caller
               (place()) catches, cancels every broker order it placed via
               _cancel_broker_orders, then routes through
               _handle_placement_failure to mark the trade FAILED + release
               the reservation, then fires kill_switch.hard_kill (capital
               tracking has broken: orders live at broker, no DB rows).
    OP-BL8c -- _handle_placement_failure accepts an optional
               broker_order_ids: Iterable[str] = (). When non-empty, runs
               _cancel_broker_orders before the existing FAILED+release
               flow. Single cleanup orchestrator for every failure path.
    OP-BL8d -- _cancel_broker_orders is best-effort. It iterates the IDs,
               calls adapter.cancel_order for each, and on result.success=False
               (or unexpected exception) logs CRITICAL with the grep-friendly
               tag CANCEL_FAILED_MANUAL_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED. It does NOT
               abort cleanup for the remaining orders.
    OP-BL8e -- hard_kill ONLY fires when DB persist fails AFTER broker
               accepted orders. Protocol-only failures (broker rejected
               cleanly) and CoPlusTgt soft failures (CO live, TGT dead) do
               NOT fire hard_kill: the protocol or place() already cancelled
               the broker side, so capital tracking is intact.
    OP-BL8f -- CoPlusTgt soft-failure path (success=False with CO live) now
               passes the live broker_order_ids to _handle_placement_failure
               so the CO is cancelled. Pre-BL-8 the CO was left live and the
               reconciler was the primary recovery; post-BL-8 the reconciler
               is a backstop.

BL-19 (locked 2026-04-19, Phase D.1):
    OP-BL19a -- place() wraps self._engine.execute in a retry loop scoped
                ONLY to BrokerRateLimit429Error. Other BrokerError subclasses
                still get a single attempt (ZA11 / OP7). The retry is narrow
                by design: a general retry would invite "retry everything"
                pattern creep.
    OP-BL19b -- The retry loop does NOT sleep. The adapter (BL-6) has
                already called rate_limiter.penalize() before raising the
                429, so the next iteration's acquire() blocks until the
                bucket thaws. That is the backoff pacing.
    OP-BL19c -- Max retries = rate_limit_backoff.max_placer_retries
                (default 3). On exhaustion, propagates via the existing
                _handle_placement_failure (FAILED + release + optional
                hard_kill -- identical to any other BrokerError).
    OP-BL19d -- Safe w.r.t. duplicate orders: each protocol raise cancels
                any in-flight legs it placed (LimitTriple cancels ENTRY on
                SL fail; CoPlusTgt has no inter-leg state on raise), so
                re-executing the protocol does not produce duplicates.
                [EXAMPLE SUPERSEDED 2026-07-22, doc-only — original above left
                legible.] The "LimitTriple cancels ENTRY on SL fail" example
                predates OP-NS1 (two-phase, 2026-04-24): engine.execute now
                places the ENTRY LIMIT only (SL/TGT are deferred to place_exits
                at fill time — see order_protocol_limit.py:148,167), so no SL is
                placed during execute() to fail. The duplicate-safety CLAIM still
                holds — a 429 raises pre-placement, so a re-executed ENTRY-only
                protocol places nothing twice.

Naked-Short Fix (locked 2026-04-24, Phase A/2.1 + 3.4):
    OP-NS1 -- LIMIT_TRIPLE is two-phase. engine.execute places ENTRY only;
              SL + TGT are DEFERRED to fill time via engine.place_deferred_exits
              at the ACTUAL filled qty (event.filled_qty), not the requested
              qty. Closes the naked-short window where ENTRY partial-fills
              (e.g. 100/1000) and TGT executes at 1000 producing a 900 short.
    OP-NS2 -- _handle_entry_fill (COMPLETE path) places exits AFTER
              commit_to_used + record_entry_fill. Order: commit → record →
              exits → smart_tgt register. commit-first so capital accounting
              matches broker truth even if exits placement raises.
    OP-NS3 -- _on_order_status_changed (partial-cancel path, Audit #7) ALSO
              places exits for any non-zero qty_filled. Pre-NS1 the Audit #7
              path committed capital but never placed SL/TGT; the pre-NS1
              protocol had already placed them at requested qty — which WAS
              the naked-short bug. Post-NS1 both paths are symmetric: fill →
              commit → record → place_exits.
    OP-NS4 -- DELIVERY intent uses SL order_type (price = trigger_price);
              INTRADAY uses SL-M. Zerodha rejects SL-M on CNC. Branch lives
              inside LimitTripleProtocol.place_exits (OPL7).
              [SUPERSEDED 2026-07-22, doc-only — original left legible.] Since
              P0 2026-06-15 (FIX-179) EVERY SL leg — INTRADAY and DELIVERY — is
              order_type "SL" (stop-limit): Zerodha rejects SL-M via the API
              entirely, not just on CNC ("Market orders without market protection
              are not allowed"; the 15-Jun rejection). The "INTRADAY uses SL-M"
              clause above is historical. See LimitTripleProtocol.place_exits
              Step 1 and price_math.calc_sl_limit_price.
    OP-NS5 -- On exit placement failure AFTER ENTRY fill: position is live
              with no SL. This is a capital-safety breach. Fire
              kill_switch.hard_kill with grep tag
              LIMIT_TRIPLE_EXITS_FAILED_POSITION_UNPROTECTED. Do NOT re-raise
              inside the event handler; reconciler is the backstop.
              [RATIONALE UPDATED 2026-07-22 — behaviour UNCHANGED; original above
              left legible.] The "position is live with no SL" reason is
              SUPERSEDED by FIX-148 (2026-06-03): _place_limit_triple_exits now
              runs _emergency_market_exit (a reverse-aware marketable-LIMIT
              flatten) BEFORE _fire_hard_kill_for_unprotected_position, so at kill
              time the position is normally already flat, not naked. The hard_kill
              is RETAINED (Rama, Decision 7, 22-Jul) on a DIFFERENT, still-valid
              rationale: an exit-placement rejection is a canary for a systemic
              bad condition — every live firing (15/16/19-Jun) was a
              multi-position storm — so the kill now stands as an ANOMALY
              CIRCUIT-BREAKER that halts the trading day, NOT as protection for a
              naked position (which FIX-148 + the reverse-aware kill-flatten sweep
              already handle). SLUnplaceableError (SL cannot be placed on the
              protective side) is the residual truly-unprotectable case. Full
              record: docs/audit/exit_rejection_hard_kill_forensics_22jul2026.md.

Atomic Registration Fix (locked 2026-04-24, Phase A/1.1):
    OP-AR1 -- Per leg, _fill_map insert MUST happen BEFORE order_monitor.track().
              Pre-fix: track() added the order to _watched first; the poll
              thread could fire OrderFilled within microseconds and look up
              _fill_map[internal_id] -> empty -> ghost-entry. Post-fix:
              _fill_map is populated first; track() second; cleanup on
              track-failure pops the just-inserted _fill_map row in
              addition to rolling back successfully_tracked legs.
    OP-AR2 -- successfully_inserted (separate from successfully_tracked)
              tracks _fill_map inserts so the OP-EF2a cleanup path can pop
              both the tracked-AND-inserted set and the inserted-but-not-
              yet-tracked entry that triggered the raise.

EF-2 (locked 2026-04-19, Phase E.6):
    OP-EF2a -- The 3-leg track()+_fill_map loop that runs AFTER
               _persist_entry_orders is wrapped in a try/except. If
               order_monitor.track() raises (duplicate internal_id
               ValueError today, any future failure mode tomorrow),
               broker orders are live + DB rows exist + monitor coverage
               is partial. Cleanup runs:
                 1. Pop any _fill_map entries this trade added pre-raise.
                 2. untrack() every successfully-tracked leg (idempotent).
                 3. Emit CRITICAL log with grep tag EF2_TRACK_FAILURE_CLEANUP.
                 4. Delegate to _handle_placement_failure (BL-8 helper):
                    cancel broker orders + mark trade FAILED + release
                    reservation.
                 5. Propagate the original exception to signal_processor.
    OP-EF2b -- Does NOT fire kill_switch.hard_kill. Capital tracking stays
               consistent (cancel-or-log-CRITICAL + release reservation).
               This is "protocol-only failure" class per OP-BL8e; hard_kill
               is reserved for DB/broker drift scenarios (BL-4/BL-8/BL-9).
               Documented inline so future maintainers do not "helpfully
               add hard_kill for symmetry."
    OP-EF2c -- Trigger today is near-impossible (new_order_id uses UUID4,
               collision probability ~0). The gap is kept closed anyway:
               symmetric to BL-8's persist-failure gap; cheap defense for
               any future failure-mode addition (new _FillEntry ctor
               validation, new track() precondition, etc.).
    OP-EF2d -- The greenlight-framed race ("fill arrives before _fill_map
               populated") is NOT addressed. Live mode is poll-based
               (delayed-discovery, bounded by poll_interval_sec; tolerable).
               Paper production mode has a 10x safety margin at
               auto_fill_delay_sec=0.5 (synth fires at T+500ms; main thread
               populates _fill_map by T+50ms). Not production-reachable;
               no quarantine queue needed.

What This Module Does NOT Do:
    - Does not implement SL modification (smart_tgt_manager's job)
    - Does not implement EOD exit (eod_squareoff's job)
    - Does not implement order timeout (order_timeout's job)
    - Does not reconcile with broker (order_reconciler's job)
    - Does not send Telegram alerts (alerts/ module's job)

        B.1 (2026-04-25): Repopulate _fill_map with non-terminal SL/TGT/EOD exit
        legs of open trades after restart.

        Without this, when OrderMonitor.rehydrate_from_store re-tracks an
        exit leg and a fill arrives, _on_order_filled looks up the
        broker-order-id-keyed _fill_map and finds nothing -- so
        _handle_exit_fill is never called and the trade never closes in DB
        (release_used + PositionClosed never fire either).

        Keying mirrors OrderMonitor.rehydrate_from_store: we use
        broker_order_id as the synthetic internal_order_id since the
        original ord_-prefixed id from new_order_id() is not persisted, and
        OrderFilled events for rehydrated legs carry broker_order_id as
        internal_order_id.

        ENTRY legs are intentionally skipped: their reservation_id is gone
        post-restart and capital state is reconstructed by
        fund_manager.rehydrate_from_open_trades. Re-entering ENTRY into
        _fill_map would route post-restart fills to _handle_entry_fill,
        which would call commit_to_used with an unknown reservation_id.

        reservation_id on the rehydrated _FillEntry is left empty:
        _handle_exit_fill does not consult it (release_used keys on
        symbol+intent, not the reservation ledger).

        Naked-short fix (2.1): place SL + TGT for a LIMIT_TRIPLE trade AFTER
        the ENTRY has filled (COMPLETE or partial-then-cancelled).

        Called from _handle_entry_fill (COMPLETE) and _on_order_status_changed
        (partial cancel with qty_filled > 0). Both paths reach here with the
        ENTRY already committed to capital and recorded in DB.

        qty_filled is the ACTUAL filled qty, not the requested qty. Sizing
        SL/TGT to the filled qty is the core of the naked-short fix: a
        partial fill of 100 shares produces SL+TGT at 100, never at 1000.

        FIX-013: TGT price is recalculated from avg_fill_price to preserve
        risk:reward ratio under entry slippage. SL price remains anchored to
        the original strategy-requested level.

        Failure policy:
          - qty_filled ≤ 0 → skip (nothing to protect).
          - place_deferred_exits raises BrokerError → position is live with
            NO SL. This is a capital-protection breach. Fire kill_switch.hard_kill
            (if injected) and log CRITICAL with grep tag
            LIMIT_TRIPLE_EXITS_FAILED_POSITION_UNPROTECTED. Do NOT re-raise:
            we are inside an event handler; the reconciler is the backstop.
          - TGT succeeded after SL failure is not possible (place_exits places
            SL first; on SL failure, TGT is not attempted). If the protocol
            raises, either nothing or only SL is placed.
          - Persist/track failures AFTER broker ack: cancel the broker orders
