"""orders/closure_classifier.py — CHECK1's evidence classifier (CW-C, 26-Jul-2026).

PURE. Takes evidence, returns a verdict, touches nothing — no DB, no broker, no
logging, no clock. That is the entire point: the decision CHECK1 gets wrong today is
made here, in isolation, where it can be exhaustively tested.

⭐ FIRST PRINCIPLE (core/closure_source.py, docs/closure_source_contract.md):
   SUPPRESS THE CRITICAL ONLY ON POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT ONE OF OUR OWN LEGS ACCOUNTS
   FOR THE CLOSE. NEVER ON ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE.

Everything unknown — broker unreachable, orders unreadable, cancel reason
unrecognised, sources disagreeing — resolves to EXTERNAL_UNATTRIBUTED at CRITICAL.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `order_reconciler._check1_manual_close` concluded "Position closed
externally" from ONE fact: the symbol is absent from get_positions(). Measured
26-Jul: 35 of 41 CLOSED_MANUAL trades had one of our OWN legs COMPLETE, and all four
CRITICAL emails ever sent were our own orders filling. The information needed to be
right was already in hand and was discarded in three separate places.
