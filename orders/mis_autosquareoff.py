orders/mis_autosquareoff.py — MIS AUTO-SQUAREOFF ORCHESTRATOR (28-Aug-2026).

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
---------------------------------------------
This is an ADD-ALONGSIDE unit. It does NOT replace, move or modify:
  * `circuit_breaker_force_close_15:15` — a SOFT_KILL that closes nothing
    (main.py:693-698). A DIFFERENT control that merely coincides in time.
  * `eod_squareoff_time: 15:17` — a COMPOUND end-of-day routine (cancel pending,
    exit positions, summary, WAL checkpoint, fund_manager.reset_daily_pnl).
    Moving it would book any 15:07-15:17 realised P&L AFTER the day's RESET_PNL
    ledger row, and a non-CAS position is broker-squared at 15:25 — eighteen
    minutes after the proposed reset. That is a silent money defect, so 15:17
    stays exactly where it is and keeps its bookkeeping role.

WHY IT EXISTS
-------------
Zerodha's earliest EQUITY-STOCK auto-square-off is 15:12 for CAS (Closing
Auction Session) stocks — the F&O-listed equities, whose continuous trading ends
at 15:15. The system's only position-closing pass ran at 15:17, i.e. FIVE MINUTES
LATE for any CAS stock, structurally, every day. On 27-Aug-2026 TATAPOWER (a CAS
stock, is_fno=true) was closed externally at 15:12:47 and the ledger carries a
Rs 59.00 "Call and Trade charges (Auto Square Off)" debit = Rs 50 + 18% GST = ONE
order.

ROLE LABELS — so nobody misreads the clocks later:
  15:03 / 15:06  PRIMARY MIS SAFETY            (this unit)
  15:09          configured protective cutoff  (config, broker-adjustable)
  15:15          SOFT_KILL — closes nothing
  15:17          EOD ACCOUNTING + EMERGENCY BACKSTOP — NOT the primary square-off

THE TWO PASSES HAVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES
--------------------------------------
  PASS 1 @ cutoff - first_offset  (15:03) — PRICE. LIMIT_THEN_MARKET, grace capped.
  PASS 2 @ cutoff - second_offset (15:06) — CERTAINTY. MARKET, NO GRACE, EVER.

SCHEDULE MOVED 03-Sep-2026 (was 15:07 / 15:10, cutoff 15:12)
------------------------------------------------------------
Zerodha publishes TWO different CAS figures — the support page says 15:12, their
03-Aug-2026 post says 15:10. Rule adopted: never design to the LATER of two
conflicting broker deadlines. The cutoff moved to 15:09 so both passes AND the
post-pass verification finish before the EARLIEST possible broker action. The old
15:10 PASS_2 sat exactly ON that boundary.
KNOWN COST, on the ledger: 15:09 is universal, so it gives up ~16 minutes of
holding time on non-CAS names (broker cutoff 15:25). A per-symbol CAS/non-CAS
deadline is the correct end state; it needs the F&O list and a lookup.

WHAT 03-Sep-2026 CHANGED IN THE FAILURE PATH (F1/F2)
----------------------------------------------------
This unit cancels the protective orders FIRST and only then decides whether it can
exit. Before 03-Sep, every failure after that point returned with the stop
cancelled and no sell placed — there was no undo. Measured twice: 02-Sep
COALINDIA and 03-Sep ANANTRAJ (which stayed naked until a human closed it).
  F1  _restore_protection() re-places the SL leg on EVERY failure path.
  F2  _verify_cancelled() now polls to a bounded deadline instead of once at
      +27-53 ms; the same orders read terminal at +1.115 s.
See docs/incident/2026-09-03_naked_position_ANANTRAJ.md.

PASS 2 owns its protocol explicitly (PASS_2_EXIT_PROTOCOL). It is NOT reached by
overriding a field on the generic EOD path, so a future maintainer changing the
general `eod_squareoff.limit_grace_sec` CANNOT reintroduce a 120s blocking sleep
into the final safety pass.

SERIALISATION — a property to PRESERVE, not to add
--------------------------------------------------
`eod_squareoff` runs ONE daemon poll thread calling check_and_fire() synchronously
(eod_squareoff.py:300-312), so a blocking _fire blocks the loop and overlap is
structurally impossible. This unit deliberately mirrors that: ONE poll thread,
both passes, evaluated sequentially, with a per-date PER-PASS fired flag under one
lock. If the two passes were ever scheduled on independent threads/timers, PASS 1
mid-promotion could collide with PASS 2's MARKET exit on the same symbol — two
exits in flight, reversing the position.

    # db filtered `leg IN ('SL','TGT')` (state_store.get_open_mis_exit_orders_for_
    # symbol), and this unit writes no orders row at all, so its own exit is
    # invisible to it. Without this gate PASS_2 would place ON TOP of a live
    # remainder and both could fill -- the exact "a long 1 becomes a short 1"
