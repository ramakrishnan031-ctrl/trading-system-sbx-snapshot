orders/order_reconciler.py — Trading System v2

Hybrid periodic + event-driven reconciliation of local trade state vs the
live broker state (G1, G3 Level 3, G5b, P14).

Locked decisions: RC1–RC20.

RC1  — Class OrderReconciler. Public API: start(), stop(), reconcile_once().
RC2  — Constructor injections: state_store, adapter, fund_manager, kill_switch,
        notifier (TelegramNotifier), bus (EventBus), logger, cfg
        (OrderReconcilerConfig), quote_fn, broker_orders_fn=None.
RC3  — Daemon poll thread fires every cfg.poll_interval_sec (P14 = 15 s).
RC4  — RETIRED. Previously subscribed OrderStateChanged for event-driven
        kicks. Audit #12 disabled at runtime (rate-limit pressure under
        bursts of OSM transitions); 2026-04-26 audit DEAD-1/CFG-4 removed
        the subscriber method and the enable_event_driven config flag.
        Reconciliation is daemon-poll only.
RC5  — Six reconciliation checks per cycle:
          (a) MANUAL_CLOSE  — local OPEN/PARTIAL, broker has no position
          (b) ORPHAN_ADOPTION — broker position, no local trade
          (c) HEALTHY        — quantities match
          (d) PARTIAL_CLOSE  — local qty > broker qty
          (e) POSITION_GREW  — broker qty > local qty
          (f) ORPHAN_ORDER   — PENDING_FILL local order not in broker open orders
                               (only when broker_orders_fn is provided)
RC6  — 3-tier action policy: COSMETIC / RECOVERABLE / UNRECOVERABLE (G1).
RC7  — G5b crash-recovery SL: for each OPEN/PARTIAL trade with no active SL
        order, fetch LTP via quote_fn and place a fresh SL (stop-limit) or MARKET exit.
RC8  — G3 Level 3 capital drift: compare adapter.get_margins().net to the
        EXPECTED broker net (fund_manager.get_snapshot().total, less capital
        held against open/reserved positions, less today's realised PnL the
        broker has not credited yet); if delta > cfg.capital_drift_tolerance
        publish CapitalDriftDetected and send a CRITICAL alert. A SECOND,
        separate reconciliation compares held margin to margins.used and its
        residual is reported, never absorbed into the drift delta. Both are
        LIVE-only: they run when the adapter reports
        produces_broker_equivalent_margins.
RC9  — ReconciliationAction dataclass fields: check_name, tier, symbol,
        trade_id (nullable), description, action_taken, success.
RC10 — Each non-COSMETIC action is persisted to reconciliation_log via
        state_store.insert_reconciliation_log().
RC11 — BrokerTimeoutError during any check: log WARNING, skip that check,
        continue with the remainder.
RC12 — BrokerAuthError: increment consecutive counter; on 3rd consecutive
        call kill_switch.soft_kill().  Counter resets on any successful
        broker call.
RC13 — reconcile_once() is non-reentrant: uses Lock.acquire(blocking=False);
        returns [] immediately if a cycle is already running.
RC14 — start() triggers one startup reconciliation before the poll thread
        begins.
RC15 — No paper-mode special-casing in reconciler; paper behaviour is owned
        by the adapter and TelegramNotifier.
RC16 — Logger name must be "order_reconciler" so L7 routing applies.
RC17 — Config section: OrderReconcilerConfig (poll_interval_sec,
        capital_drift_tolerance).
RC18 — G5b order placement calls adapter.place_order() directly; no import
        from orders.order_placer.
RC19 — reconciliation_log table added in schema v6 (TABLE 13).
RC20 — reconcile_once() returns List[ReconciliationAction] for white-box
        testing.

        Task 4 (2026-06-19): resolve trades stuck in EXITING.

        A HARD_KILL / emergency flatten marks a trade EXITING before flattening
        (Bug A, FIX-190). EXITING is meant to be transient (EXITING ->
        CLOSED/CLOSED_MANUAL once the exit reconciles). If the process dies
        mid-exit (the 19-Jun incident) the trade lingers in EXITING with locked
        capital + orphan SL/TGT, and CHECK1/G5b never touch it (they only act on
        OPEN/PARTIAL/PENDING_FILL). Resolved here against broker truth:
          - flat at broker -> CHECK1 finalize (CLOSED_MANUAL + release capital +

        FIX-181: flatten a broker position with a marketable LIMIT (LTP ± buffer,
        adapter snaps to tick) so it fills but caps slippage; MARKET fallback if
        no LTP. Returns True if an order was placed. Best-effort — never raises.

        ⛔ PRECONDITION, enforced by the caller, not here: this function SELLS, so
        it must never be reached for a delivery (CNC) position — Q4/#2b, delivery
        survives a HARD_KILL — **nor for a COVER ORDER (CO) position** — #2c-R,
        a CO position cannot be squared by a reverse order at all (Audit 3.1) and
        this path has no parent bracket id to cancel, so the caller REFUSES and
        escalates instead. Its ONE caller, _check2_inflight_orphan, applies both
        branches before calling; a test pins that it stays the only caller.
        A NEW caller must apply them too.
        ⚠️ CO is a MEMBER of EMERGENCY_FLATTEN_PRODUCTS (that set is shared with
        four other sites and must not be narrowed) — which is exactly why the CO
        refusal is a site-local branch placed BEFORE the membership test.

        ⚠️⚠️ DISCLOSED, NOT CHANGED — AND ⛔ A MAPPING FIX CANNOT CURE IT.
        `intent` below is hardcoded INTRADAY. #2b reported this as "a CO position
        would exit under an MIS intent", which understated it; #2c's Step-1
        (02-Aug, read-only) measured the real shape and STOPPED before editing:

          (a) `intent` IS the live Kite `product` field, not a label —
              place_order resolves it via product_resolver (INTRADAY→MIS,
              DELIVERY→CNC, COVER_ORDER→CO) and sends it as `product=`.
          (b) ⛔ Audit 3.1: a CO position CANNOT be squared off by a reverse
              order at all — the broker rejects it and auto-squares at 15:20
              with a ₹50+GST penalty. The correct path is
              `cancel_order(entry_broker_id, variety="co")` on the parent
              bracket, which is what EOD already does (eod_squareoff.py: the
              Audit-3.1 comment above `is_co`, the cancel call, and the
              missing-entry-id CRITICAL). So mapping CO→COVER_ORDER here would
              merely emit the order the broker refuses.
          (c) THIS PATH CANNOT REACH A PARENT ORDER ID. Inputs are (symbol, bp,
              tag_prefix, trade_id); `bp` is a broker POSITION row (symbol, qty,
              avg_price, product, side). `trade_id` IS present — it is the only
              affordance any redesign has to look one up.
          (d) TODAY'S REAL BEHAVIOUR on a CO position, stated plainly: product
              "MIS" is ACCEPTED by the broker, does NOT net against the CO
              position (Kite nets per (symbol, product)), and therefore opens a
              NAKED MIS SHORT while the CO position survives.
          (e) Doubly dormant, so this is LATENT, not live: CO has never been
              used (order_protocol_co.py — 805/805 regular, X6; declared by
              12/15 YAMLs and discarded), AND force_intraday_only: true coerces
              every non-INTRADAY intent back to INTRADAY inside place_order.
          (f) ⚠️ PAPER CANNOT VALIDATE THIS CLASS: paper nets by SYMBOL
              (_paper_positions) while live Kite nets per (symbol, product) — a
              paper drill of any product-semantics change is vacuously green.
          (g) This caller never passes `variety`; place_order defaults
              "regular" and nothing validates variety-against-product. Latent
              hazard for ANY future non-INTRADAY intent placed here.

        ⇒ #2c is CLOSED as STOPPED AT STEP-1 (a validated redesign trigger).
        ⛔ Do not "fix" this by mapping the intent. The redesign is #2c-R.

        Local qty_filled > broker qty — partial position closure at broker (RC5d).

        FIX-148 (A3): position/order side — update qty_filled, cancel stale SL/TGT
        (G5b re-places at the reduced qty on the next cycle), Telegram alert.

        M-O2 (Wave-6, audit 04-Jul): ALSO reconcile the capital/PnL side for the
        externally-closed portion. CHECK1 (full close) releases capital + books PnL
        via fm.release_used; CHECK4 historically skipped it, so the margin for the
        closed (phantom) qty stayed locked in ``used`` all session and its realized
        PnL never entered daily_realized — the FM7 daily-loss gate could not see a
        partial stop-out. Fix: mirror CHECK1 proportionally with
        release_used(exit_qty=closed_qty), freeing the closed portion's margin and
        booking its PnL into fm_ledger/daily_realized.

        E4 (2026-07-17): that PnL is now NET — the closed slice is costed with the
        shared CostCalculator (was costs=0.0, which made these rows gross while
        every other row was net). The costs are for the CLOSED SLICE only; the
        remainder is costed when it closes.

        Exactly-once via a qty_filled CAS (``WHERE qty_filled=local_qty``): only the
        cycle that actually observes the local->broker transition performs the
        release, so a re-detected same-delta cycle (or a crash between the release
        and the qty write) cannot double-release; sequential DIFFERENT partials each
        match their own current qty and release their own delta. Ordering is CAS
        (claim) THEN release: a release failure after the claim leaves the margin
        un-freed (conservative under-release, logged loud) rather than risking a
        double-release — the safe failure direction for a capital guard.

        The trade STAYS OPEN/PARTIAL — no mark_trade_manually_closed, no close_trade
        CAS -> no terminal write -> the terminal-state guard stays silent. No
        terminal net_pnl is written on a partial (trades.net_pnl finalizes at full
        close; fm_ledger.pnl_delta is the source of truth for daily-loss +
        reservable). PositionClosed is deliberately NOT published on a partial: its
        subscribers treat it as a FULL close (paper adapter pops the WHOLE position;
        slippage_recorder writes a completed-trade roll-up; shadow_tracker opens an
        inning) — all wrong for a still-open position.

    #
    # On 03-Sep the emergency exit was attempted EIGHT times in 111.4 s
    # (15:10:17.585 -> 15:12:09.406) and rejected identically every time:
    #   "Market orders without market protection are not allowed via API."
    # That is a VALIDATION rejection. It is deterministic -- attempt 9 fails the
    # same way. In the two minutes that mattered the system repeated a doomed
    # call instead of escalating once, unmistakably.
    #
    # Why FIX-155's existing pending-guard could not stop it: it queries for an
    # orders row (leg='EOD' AND order_type='MARKET' AND status IN PENDING/
    # SUBMITTED/OPEN), and a REJECTED order returns no order_id, so it persists
    # NO row. The guard had nothing to find. (That is also why
    # `orders WHERE order_type='MARKET'` is 0 of 1315 despite 8 attempts.)
    #
    # CONSERVATIVE BY CONSTRUCTION. A wrongly-TERMINAL verdict loses a real
    # exit, which is far worse than a wasted retry, so:
    #   * TERMINAL needs BOTH the translated type AND a MEASURED message match;
    #   * the allow-list holds only what has actually been observed;
    #   * anything unrecognised stays RETRYABLE.

        """
        G3 Level 3 (RC8). TWO checks, deliberately NOT merged:

          CHECK 1 (drift)  expected_broker_net  vs  margins.net
          CHECK 2 (margin) system_held_capital  vs  margins.used

        WHY CHECK 1 CHANGED (20-Aug-2026, measured live).
        This compared `snapshot.total` directly against `margins.net`. Those are
        DIFFERENT QUANTITIES, so an open book guaranteed a delta:

          * `snapshot.total` is REAL CAPITAL — the account value. It is mutated
            at exactly five sites (fund_manager INIT / SYNC / carry / +-PnL) and
            by NO reserve or commit path, so it does not fall when a position is
            opened. That is correct and must stay correct.
          * `margins.net` is broker CASH, which DOES fall by the margin the
            broker blocks, and does NOT include today's realised PnL (equity
            settles T+1).

        Measured 20-Aug: four CRITICAL alarms, deltas 1155.50 / 1101.63 /
        1572.82 / 1311.86, every one of which decomposed EXACTLY (residual 0.00)
        into broker-blocked margin + today's realised PnL. They were false
        positives reporting normal deployment as capital loss.

        The identity, from the same measurements:

            margins.net == snapshot.total - held - daily_realized_pnl

        where `held` is reserved+used across both buckets. FIX-190 had papered
        over this by widening the in-session tolerance to 10% of `expected` —
        its own comment says the band exists because "broker margin legitimately
        drops by the deployed capital". That band is left untouched here: this
        change removes the REASON for it rather than the band, and retiring the
        band is a separate decision needing multi-day observation.

        CARRY CANCELS, and is deliberately absent from CHECK 1. For a position
        carried overnight the broker had ALREADY removed its margin from `net`
        before today began; rehydrate names that as `*_carry` and lifts `_total`
        by it (fund_manager FIX 1). So with carry C, broker net N, new margin M:
        total = N + C, held = C + M, expected = (N+C) - (C+M) = N - M. Exact.
        CHECK 2 DOES subtract carry, because a carried position contributes to
        `held` but (being already settled) not to today's broker `used`.

        KNOWN RESIDUALS — CHECK 1 is not expected to reach 0.00:
          (a) broker MIS margin is per-instrument and marked to market, while
              leverage_map.INTRADAY is a flat 5.0 (20-Aug: ~Rs 0.32 on one leg;
              INFERRED, order_margins() was not called to prove it);
          (b) the 5% RESERVE buffer overstates `held` between placement and
              fill (20-Aug 11:07:14: Rs 21.64, cleared at COMMIT 19s later);
          (c) after a MID-SESSION restart, initialize() sets _total from broker
              cash and _intraday_carry is deliberately left 0.0 (fund_manager
              FIX 1, "NOT MEASURED"), so an open intraday position leaves a
              residual. Pre-existing structure, surfaced here, not created here.

        DELTA SEMANTICS AND THE KILL LADDER: unchanged in effect. G3 publishes
        with source_module="order_reconciler", which is NOT in drift_handler's
        _ESCALATING_SOURCES {fund_manager, fund_manager_self_check,
        fund_manager_bucket_overflow}; drift_handler DH1 logs it at INFO and
        ignores it for escalation, and its docstring already anticipates that
        reconciler delta semantics differ. So narrowing this delta cannot change
        kill escalation in either direction.

        If |actual - expected| > cfg.capital_drift_tolerance:
          - Publish CapitalDriftDetected(expected, actual, delta)
          - Send CRITICAL alert via TelegramNotifier (which also writes sentinel)
