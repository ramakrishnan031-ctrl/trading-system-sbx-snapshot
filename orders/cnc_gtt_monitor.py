"""
orders/cnc_gtt_monitor.py — SLICE2.5-P2 (25-Jun-2026): durable CNC overnight-GTT reconcile.

THE shared routine (startup [4a] + 15-min monitor [4b], DRY) that keeps a delivery
position's ONE broker-side OCO GTT in sync with reality. The BROKER GTT is the
authority; ``gtt_state`` is the durable local mirror.

Per ACTIVE gtt_state row it gathers the live broker GTT (get_gtts) + the held qty
(holdings + same-day CNC positions) and applies the M1 (qty) + M2 (one ACTIVE GTT)
invariants, then acts per the K6 ladder:

  GTT active + holding + qty match     -> healthy (touch last_verified_at)
  GTT triggered + holding FLAT         -> GTT_EXIT: finalise trade (3.5) — the PRIMARY
                                          delivery exit path, SYSTEM-OWNED (not human)
  GTT triggered + holding STILL > 0    -> F6 CRITICAL re-protect the remaining qty
  GTT missing + holding + qty match    -> AUTO-RECREATE in-hours (Y3 fresh LTP) /
                                          QUEUE pre-open (Y1) + WARN
  QTY MISMATCH (held != row.qty, > 0)  -> CRITICAL ONCE (Y2 needs_review) + cancel the
                                          wrong-qty GTT + NO recreate + NO soft-kill
  GTT active + holding FLAT            -> orphan: forensic-log + delete_gtt + finalise
  >1 ACTIVE GTT for one trade          -> SOFT-KILL (ownership ambiguity)

Parity: paper backs get_gtts/holdings/place_gtt/delete_gtt with an in-memory store,
so the whole routine runs end-to-end in paper (Y7 injected-state tests). Y4: a broker
gather failure DEFERS the cycle + alerts — it never crashes and never treats "no data"
as "no positions". NI-12 (23-Aug-2026): the Phase-2 sentence here said delivery_enabled
stays false. It is TRUE (:102) and delivery has traded; this routine now runs against a
live book, which is the whole reason its GTT lifecycle matters.

⚠️ ONE THING PAPER CANNOT DO, AND IT SAYS SO (26-Jul-2026): the paper stores are
in-memory and die with the nightly restart while `gtt_state` survives, so the morning
after a paper carry this routine emits a clean GTT_EXIT for a position that was never
held. `_announce_paper_carry_blind_spot` states that BEFORE the misleading exit rather
than after it — paper-only, by a mode check. The carry is a live-only proof; see
docs/audit/paper_overnight_carry_26jul2026.md.

        """PAPER ONLY. Announce that this pass cannot prove the overnight carry —
        because it is about to emit artefacts indistinguishable from proof that it did.

        THE MECHANISM, measured. Paper's positions, holdings and GTTs are in-memory
        dicts on the adapter (zerodha_adapter.py:424/429/432) and the nightly restart
        erases all three; ``gtt_state`` is a real table and survives, by design. So on
        the morning after a paper CNC carry ``_gather()`` returns empty/empty/empty
        against a live ACTIVE row, ``_handle_row`` falls past rungs 1-3 to rung 4's
        "GTT gone + flat -> the GTT did its job" branch, and ``_finalize_gtt_exit``
        books a P&L at today's LTP (paper ``get_trades()`` is ``[]``, so the price
        resolves off the quote), releases the delivery reservation, publishes
        PositionClosed and marks the row CLEANED.

        WHY IT IS WORTH SAYING OUT LOUD: every one of those artefacts is identical to
        a real carried exit. That is not weak evidence, it is ACTIVE MISINFORMATION
        about the one path that holds capital overnight — and silence is the dangerous
        version, because "paper-proven" is the literal gate on delivery going live. So
        the run states its own blind spot, and states it BEFORE the misleading
        GTT_EXIT rather than after it.

        LIVE IS UNREACHABLE BY CONSTRUCTION, and by a MODE check rather than a config
        flag somebody could flip: this returns immediately unless the process is a
        paper run. In live the premise is false anyway — the broker's holdings and
        GTTs are real and survive the restart, which is precisely what the Mon->Tue
        live pair exists to demonstrate.

        ⛔ It does NOT change what the reconcile then does. Making paper behave
        differently from live here would be its own parity lie; the fix for the gap is
        a live pair, not a settlement model.
